      "description": "<p>Indigenous to the mountain regions of southern Europe, lemon balm is now a common plant found in gardens everywhere. Often called “bee balm” – because of a myth that this fragrant herb attracts honey bees more than other plants – the plant’s flavorful leaves are often used in the form of a refreshing tea. In Medieval times, drinks with lemon balm were thought to comfort the heart and lift the spirits. Today, the herb is used both internally and topically and may help support mental calm and healthy relaxation and rest. Solaray Lemon Balm Aerial contains the whole aerial, making sure you get all the nutrients contained in the plant. Like all Solaray products, Lemon Balm is lab verified for potency, purity, and identity. Confidence in the Solaray name is just one of the reasons we’ve been around so long and maintain our place as a leader in the industry. Unlike many other companies, we manufacture almost all our own products in our GMP-certified facility and thoroughly test and screen raw ingredients in our state-of-the-art in-house lab for the slightest amount of impurities. This allows us to manage the production process from beginning to end so we can provide the best possible quality. Rest assured, only the purest formulas ever reach your cabinet. And because we are always committed to leaving the world a little better than we found it, we package this product in 100% post consumer recycled plastic bottles.</p>",

      "description": "Bulk Herbs: Lemon Balm (Organic)\nMelissa officinalis\n\nFormat: C/S\nSize: 1 oz package\n\nAlso known as: Melissa officinalis, melissa, balm\n\nFarming Type: Organic\nOrigin: Bulgaria\n\nLemon balm is a flowering perennial native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It has since been cultivated in other parts of the world, and has become naturalized in North America. It is a member of the mint family, possessing a pleasant aroma, strikingly similar to that of lemon. The herb can grow to nearly five feet tall, producing small white flowers. The Latin name “Melissa” translates to “bee,” referring to the plant’s ability to attract honeybees and other insects.\n\nThe German Commission E has approved lemon balm for supporting a calm and healthy sleep. It has also been approved in supporting the gastrointestinal tract. Lemon balm has been shown in clinical trials to support healthy memory and cognitive function, as well as to increase self-reported calmness.\n\nIn magick, Lemon Balm is ruled by Moon and Water and is therefore a wonderful herb for healing and calm. A great herb to use for reducing stress and for healing emotional traumas.\n\nKeywords: Healing, peace, success\n\nFor educational purposes only This information has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "description": "Lemon Balm (Melissa Officinalis) Organic Dried Leaf Liquid Extract, Melisa, Herbal Supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melissa officinalis, known as Lemon balm, Balm, Common Balm, or Balm Mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the mint familyÂ Lamiaceae, native to south-central Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean region, and Central Asia.Â It grows to 70â150 cm (28â59 in) tall. The leaves have a gentle lemon scent, related to mint. During summer, small white flowers full of nectar appear.Â Lemon balm seeds require light and at least 20 Â°C (70 Â°F) to germinate. Lemon balm grows in clumps and spreadsÂ vegetatively, as well as by seed. In mild temperate zones, the stems of the plant die off at the start of the winter, but shoot up again in spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Organic Lemon Balm (Melissa Officinalis) Dry Leaf. Origin: USA. Menstruum: Alcohol, vegetable palm glycerin, crystal clear water.
