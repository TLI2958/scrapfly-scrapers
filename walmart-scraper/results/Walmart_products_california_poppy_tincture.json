      "description": "<p>A sharp mind starts with good food. The mind consumes significantly more energy than other organs in our body. Everything we think and do courses through the brain, hence its need for resources to function optimally. But, let's face it. We don't always do a good job of nurturing our nervous system. It's never too late to do so, especially with lion's mane mushroom. It's been traditionally used in East Asia to support cognitive wellness. We've concentrated its potency in a liquid supplement. Be better at looking after your brain wellness with the Herbamama Lion's Mane Liquid Extract.</p><p>Lion's mane (Hericium erinaceus) is a wonderful mushroom for your cognitive function. It has been shown to stimulate the growth of brain cells. This characteristic may help boost your memory, maintain your concentration, and improve your mood. It may keep you energized and rejuvenated through challenging times, too. But that's not all there is to it. One great thing about this mushroom is that it supports your brain's health for the long term. It may have an impact on nerve cell regeneration, which may help offset the deterioration of your nervous system that happens with age. And since it's rich in antioxidants, it may keep your immune system robust as well.</p>",

Everything we think and do courses through the brain, hence its need for resources to function optimally. But, let's face it. We don't always do a good job of nurturing our nervous system. It's never too late to do so, especially with lion's mane mushroom. It's been traditionally used in East Asia to support cognitive wellness. We've concentrated its potency in a liquid supplement. Be better at looking after your brain wellness with the Herbamama Lion's Mane Liquid Extract.</p><p>Lion's mane (Hericium erinaceus) is a wonderful mushroom for your cognitive function. It has been shown to stimulate the growth of brain cells. This characteristic may help boost your memory, maintain your concentration, and improve your mood. It may keep you energized and rejuvenated through challenging times, too. But that's not all there is to it. One great thing about this mushroom is that it supports your brain's health for the long term. It may have an impact on nerve cell regeneration, which may help offset the deterioration of your nervous system that happens with age. And since it's rich in antioxidants, it may keep your immune system robust as well.</p>",
