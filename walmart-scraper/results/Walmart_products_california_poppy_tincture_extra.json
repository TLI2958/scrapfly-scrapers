It is a perennial or annual growing to 5–60 in (13–152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Certified Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) dry above-ground parts.

Everything we think and do courses through the brain, hence its need for resources to function optimally. But, let's face it. We don't always do a good job of nurturing our nervous system. It's never too late to do so, especially with lion's mane mushroom. It's been traditionally used in East Asia to support cognitive wellness. We've concentrated its potency in a liquid supplement. Be better at looking after your brain wellness with the Herbamama Lion's Mane Liquid Extract.</p><p>Lion's mane (Hericium erinaceus) is a wonderful mushroom for your cognitive function. It has been shown to stimulate the growth of brain cells. This characteristic may help boost your memory, maintain your concentration, and improve your mood. It may keep you energized and rejuvenated through challenging times, too. But that's not all there is to it. One great thing about this mushroom is that it supports your brain's health for the long term. It may have an impact on nerve cell regeneration, which may help offset the deterioration of your nervous system that happens with age. And since it's rich in antioxidants, it may keep your immune system robust as well.</p>",

Everything we think and do courses through the brain, hence its need for resources to function optimally. But, let's face it. We don't always do a good job of nurturing our nervous system. It's never too late to do so, especially with lion's mane mushroom. It's been traditionally used in East Asia to support cognitive wellness. We've concentrated its potency in a liquid supplement. Be better at looking after your brain wellness with the Herbamama Lion's Mane Liquid Extract.</p><p>Lion's mane (Hericium erinaceus) is a wonderful mushroom for your cognitive function. It has been shown to stimulate the growth of brain cells. This characteristic may help boost your memory, maintain your concentration, and improve your mood.
