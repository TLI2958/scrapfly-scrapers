California Poppy (Golden Poppy, California Sunlight, Cup of Gold) is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae, native to the United States and Mexico, and the official state flower of California. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina. KavaÂ orÂ Kava-KavaÂ (PiperÂ methysticum) is a crop of the westernÂ Pacific. The Kava shrub thrives in loose, well-drained soils where plenty of air reaches the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Certified Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica).

It is a perennial or annual growing to 5–60 in (13–152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Dry Seeds Powder.

      "description": "California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Organic Dried Seeds Powder Liquid Extract, Golden Poppy, Herbal Supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California Poppy (Golden Poppy, California Sunlight, Cup of Gold) is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae, native to the United States and Mexico, and the official state flower of California. It is a perennial or annual growing to 5â60 in (13â152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Dry Seeds Powder.
