My digestion feels smoother, and I've experienced a slight boost in energy levels.

The pills are also relatively easy to swallow and one of the reasons I love them is because it doesn't have the “after swallow” issue that I have previously had with other milk thistle supplements.\n\nBasically other supplements when swallowed disintegrated very fast and I could taste the unpleasant thing! But not so with this one!\n\nMilk thistle is a traditional herb that has potential benefits to liver health. I take two pills daily with food."

        "review_title": "A Green Powerhouse: My Take on SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder",
        "review_text": "In my quest for a healthier lifestyle, I discovered SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder, 8.5 oz (240 g), and decided to integrate it into my daily nutrition. Spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, is famed for its impressive nutrient profile and health benefits. Here's my experience after incorporating this superfood into my routine for the past couple of months.Taste and Texture: Spirulina has a distinctive, somewhat \"fishy\" taste, which can be off-putting to some. However, when mixed into smoothies, juices, or even yogurts, its flavor becomes almost imperceptible. The powder itself is fine and blends well, although it does turn everything a deep shade of green.Nutritional Benefits: This spirulina powder is a nutritional powerhouse, rich in protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins), minerals (including iron and magnesium), and antioxidants. I started taking it to boost my energy levels and support my immune system, and I've definitely noticed a difference. My energy has been more consistent, and I've felt generally healthier and more resilient against common colds.Ease of Use: The powder format is incredibly versatile. I've experimented with adding it to various dishes and drinks. My favorite way to consume it is blended into a morning smoothie with fruits, which masks the taste while still delivering all the benefits.Effectiveness: It's hard to quantify the effect of any one supplement, but I can say that since adding spirulina powder to my diet, I've noticed an overall improvement in my energy and vitality. It's also been a great way to ensure I get a broad spectrum of nutrients in my diet, especially on days when my vegetable intake is less than optimal.Digestibility: I was initially concerned about potential digestive issues, as spirulina is quite high in fiber, but I've had no adverse effects. It seems to have actually contributed positively to my digestive health.Value: Given the density of nutrients and the amount of product you get, I find this spirulina powder to offer excellent value for money. It's an affordable and efficient way to supplement a healthy diet.Final Verdict: SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder has earned a permanent spot in my pantry. It's an easy, effective way to boost my nutritional intake, and I appreciate the versatility and health benefits it offers. For anyone looking to enhance their diet with a nutrient-rich superfood, I highly recommend giving this spirulina powder a try."

      "description": "California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Tincture, Organic Dried Seeds Powder Liquid Extract (Herbal Terra, USA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California Poppy (Golden Poppy, California Sunlight, Cup of Gold) is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae, native to the United States and Mexico, and the official state flower of California. It is a perennial or annual growing to 5–60 in (13–152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Dry Seeds Powder.

It is a perennial or annual growing to 5–60 in (13–152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates.

But I am sure that dosage and results will vary from person to person.  This is something I will keep in my medicine cabinet and my first aid kit.  Far safer than Aspirin!  \r\n\r\nUpdate:  A few days ago I took the full dose at night and still had no hangover effect, rather awoke feeling fresh and energetic.  I'm glad to have found this product and glad my local health food store carries it for emergency purchases."

        "review_text": "In my quest for a healthier lifestyle, I discovered SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder, 8.5 oz (240 g), and decided to integrate it into my daily nutrition. Spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, is famed for its impressive nutrient profile and health benefits. Here's my experience after incorporating this superfood into my routine for the past couple of months.Taste and Texture: Spirulina has a distinctive, somewhat \"fishy\" taste, which can be off-putting to some. However, when mixed into smoothies, juices, or even yogurts, its flavor becomes almost imperceptible. The powder itself is fine and blends well, although it does turn everything a deep shade of green.Nutritional Benefits: This spirulina powder is a nutritional powerhouse, rich in protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins), minerals (including iron and magnesium), and antioxidants. I started taking it to boost my energy levels and support my immune system, and I've definitely noticed a difference. My energy has been more consistent, and I've felt generally healthier and more resilient against common colds.Ease of Use: The powder format is incredibly versatile. I've experimented with adding it to various dishes and drinks. My favorite way to consume it is blended into a morning smoothie with fruits, which masks the taste while still delivering all the benefits.Effectiveness: It's hard to quantify the effect of any one supplement, but I can say that since adding spirulina powder to my diet, I've noticed an overall improvement in my energy and vitality. It's also been a great way to ensure I get a broad spectrum of nutrients in my diet, especially on days when my vegetable intake is less than optimal.Digestibility: I was initially concerned about potential digestive issues, as spirulina is quite high in fiber, but I've had no adverse effects. It seems to have actually contributed positively to my digestive health.Value: Given the density of nutrients and the amount of product you get, I find this spirulina powder to offer excellent value for money. It's an affordable and efficient way to supplement a healthy diet.Final Verdict: SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder has earned a permanent spot in my pantry. It's an easy, effective way to boost my nutritional intake, and I appreciate the versatility and health benefits it offers. For anyone looking to enhance their diet with a nutrient-rich superfood, I highly recommend giving this spirulina powder a try."

It is a perennial or annual growing to 5–60 in (13–152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather.

        "review_text": "In my quest for a healthier lifestyle, I discovered SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder, 8.5 oz (240 g), and decided to integrate it into my daily nutrition. Spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, is famed for its impressive nutrient profile and health benefits. Here's my experience after incorporating this superfood into my routine for the past couple of months.Taste and Texture: Spirulina has a distinctive, somewhat \"fishy\" taste, which can be off-putting to some. However, when mixed into smoothies, juices, or even yogurts, its flavor becomes almost imperceptible. The powder itself is fine and blends well, although it does turn everything a deep shade of green.Nutritional Benefits: This spirulina powder is a nutritional powerhouse, rich in protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins), minerals (including iron and magnesium), and antioxidants. I started taking it to boost my energy levels and support my immune system, and I've definitely noticed a difference. My energy has been more consistent, and I've felt generally healthier and more resilient against common colds.Ease of Use: The powder format is incredibly versatile. I've experimented with adding it to various dishes and drinks. My favorite way to consume it is blended into a morning smoothie with fruits, which masks the taste while still delivering all the benefits.Effectiveness: It's hard to quantify the effect of any one supplement, but I can say that since adding spirulina powder to my diet, I've noticed an overall improvement in my energy and vitality. It's also been a great way to ensure I get a broad spectrum of nutrients in my diet, especially on days when my vegetable intake is less than optimal.Digestibility: I was initially concerned about potential digestive issues, as spirulina is quite high in fiber, but I've had no adverse effects. It seems to have actually contributed positively to my digestive health.Value: Given the density of nutrients and the amount of product you get, I find this spirulina powder to offer excellent value for money. It's an affordable and efficient way to supplement a healthy diet.Final Verdict: SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder has earned a permanent spot in my pantry. It's an easy, effective way to boost my nutritional intake, and I appreciate the versatility and health benefits it offers. For anyone looking to enhance their diet with a nutrient-rich superfood, I highly recommend giving this spirulina powder a try."

I stopped taking it after several months and slowly but surely started to feel the depression and anxiety again. I wasn't convinced that the SJW helped me before due to his negativity about SJW but now that I'm taking it again within a week I'm so much better. This pill helps me wake up happy!!!"

EuroHerbs, known for their rigorous quality standards, have delivered a potent 300 mg dose of St. John's Wort in each of the 60 veggie capsules. This reassures me that I'm getting a reliable and effective product.\n\nSt. John's Wort is renowned for its potential to alleviate mild mood swings and promote emotional balance. I've personally found that this supplement has helped me maintain a more positive outlook on challenging days and provides a sense of inner calm.\n\nThe veggie capsules are easy to swallow and gentle on the stomach. I appreciate that they are suitable for vegetarians and vegans, making them accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of St. John's Wort can vary from person to person, and it may take a few weeks of consistent use to experience noticeable results. I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.\n\nOne minor drawback is that St. John's Wort can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's essential to take precautions when exposed to the sun. However, this is a known side effect of this herbal supplement and is not specific to this particular brand.\n\nIn summary, California Gold Nutrition St. John's Wort offers a natural and European-quality option for those seeking to support their emotional well-being. While it may not provide immediate results and should be used with caution, it's a worthwhile addition to a holistic approach to mental health. If you're looking for a natural mood booster, these veggie capsules are worth considering."

It is a perennial or annual growing to 5–60 in (13–152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Dry Seeds Powder.

This brand is also known for high quality ingredients so getting this superfood on sale was an amazing deal.

        "review_title": "A Green Powerhouse: My Take on SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder",
        "review_text": "In my quest for a healthier lifestyle, I discovered SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder, 8.5 oz (240 g), and decided to integrate it into my daily nutrition. Spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, is famed for its impressive nutrient profile and health benefits. Here's my experience after incorporating this superfood into my routine for the past couple of months.Taste and Texture: Spirulina has a distinctive, somewhat \"fishy\" taste, which can be off-putting to some. However, when mixed into smoothies, juices, or even yogurts, its flavor becomes almost imperceptible. The powder itself is fine and blends well, although it does turn everything a deep shade of green.Nutritional Benefits: This spirulina powder is a nutritional powerhouse, rich in protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins), minerals (including iron and magnesium), and antioxidants. I started taking it to boost my energy levels and support my immune system, and I've definitely noticed a difference. My energy has been more consistent, and I've felt generally healthier and more resilient against common colds.Ease of Use: The powder format is incredibly versatile. I've experimented with adding it to various dishes and drinks. My favorite way to consume it is blended into a morning smoothie with fruits, which masks the taste while still delivering all the benefits.Effectiveness: It's hard to quantify the effect of any one supplement, but I can say that since adding spirulina powder to my diet, I've noticed an overall improvement in my energy and vitality. It's also been a great way to ensure I get a broad spectrum of nutrients in my diet, especially on days when my vegetable intake is less than optimal.Digestibility: I was initially concerned about potential digestive issues, as spirulina is quite high in fiber, but I've had no adverse effects. It seems to have actually contributed positively to my digestive health.Value: Given the density of nutrients and the amount of product you get, I find this spirulina powder to offer excellent value for money. It's an affordable and efficient way to supplement a healthy diet.Final Verdict: SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder has earned a permanent spot in my pantry. It's an easy, effective way to boost my nutritional intake, and I appreciate the versatility and health benefits it offers. For anyone looking to enhance their diet with a nutrient-rich superfood, I highly recommend giving this spirulina powder a try."

EuroHerbs, known for their rigorous quality standards, have delivered a potent 300 mg dose of St. John's Wort in each of the 60 veggie capsules. This reassures me that I'm getting a reliable and effective product.\n\nSt. John's Wort is renowned for its potential to alleviate mild mood swings and promote emotional balance. I've personally found that this supplement has helped me maintain a more positive outlook on challenging days and provides a sense of inner calm.\n\nThe veggie capsules are easy to swallow and gentle on the stomach. I appreciate that they are suitable for vegetarians and vegans, making them accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of St. John's Wort can vary from person to person, and it may take a few weeks of consistent use to experience noticeable results. I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.\n\nOne minor drawback is that St. John's Wort can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's essential to take precautions when exposed to the sun. However, this is a known side effect of this herbal supplement and is not specific to this particular brand.\n\nIn summary, California Gold Nutrition St. John's Wort offers a natural and European-quality option for those seeking to support their emotional well-being. While it may not provide immediate results and should be used with caution, it's a worthwhile addition to a holistic approach to mental health. If you're looking for a natural mood booster, these veggie capsules are worth considering."

        "review_text": "California Gold Nutrition's St. John's Wort has been a welcomed addition to my daily wellness regimen, and it's quickly become a trusted companion in supporting my emotional well-being.\n\nOne of the standout features of this product is its European quality. EuroHerbs, known for their rigorous quality standards, have delivered a potent 300 mg dose of St. John's Wort in each of the 60 veggie capsules. This reassures me that I'm getting a reliable and effective product.\n\nSt. John's Wort is renowned for its potential to alleviate mild mood swings and promote emotional balance. I've personally found that this supplement has helped me maintain a more positive outlook on challenging days and provides a sense of inner calm.\n\nThe veggie capsules are easy to swallow and gentle on the stomach. I appreciate that they are suitable for vegetarians and vegans, making them accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of St. John's Wort can vary from person to person, and it may take a few weeks of consistent use to experience noticeable results. I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.\n\nOne minor drawback is that St. John's Wort can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's essential to take precautions when exposed to the sun. However, this is a known side effect of this herbal supplement and is not specific to this particular brand.\n\nIn summary, California Gold Nutrition St. John's Wort offers a natural and European-quality option for those seeking to support their emotional well-being. While it may not provide immediate results and should be used with caution, it's a worthwhile addition to a holistic approach to mental health. If you're looking for a natural mood booster, these veggie capsules are worth considering."

      "description": "California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Tincture, Organic Dried Seeds Powder Liquid Extract (Herbal Terra, USA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California Poppy (Golden Poppy, California Sunlight, Cup of Gold) is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae, native to the United States and Mexico, and the official state flower of California. It is a perennial or annual growing to 5–60 in (13–152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Dry Seeds Powder.

        "review_title": "A Green Powerhouse: My Take on SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder",
        "review_text": "In my quest for a healthier lifestyle, I discovered SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder, 8.5 oz (240 g), and decided to integrate it into my daily nutrition. Spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, is famed for its impressive nutrient profile and health benefits. Here's my experience after incorporating this superfood into my routine for the past couple of months.Taste and Texture: Spirulina has a distinctive, somewhat \"fishy\" taste, which can be off-putting to some. However, when mixed into smoothies, juices, or even yogurts, its flavor becomes almost imperceptible. The powder itself is fine and blends well, although it does turn everything a deep shade of green.Nutritional Benefits: This spirulina powder is a nutritional powerhouse, rich in protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins), minerals (including iron and magnesium), and antioxidants. I started taking it to boost my energy levels and support my immune system, and I've definitely noticed a difference. My energy has been more consistent, and I've felt generally healthier and more resilient against common colds.Ease of Use: The powder format is incredibly versatile. I've experimented with adding it to various dishes and drinks. My favorite way to consume it is blended into a morning smoothie with fruits, which masks the taste while still delivering all the benefits.Effectiveness: It's hard to quantify the effect of any one supplement, but I can say that since adding spirulina powder to my diet, I've noticed an overall improvement in my energy and vitality. It's also been a great way to ensure I get a broad spectrum of nutrients in my diet, especially on days when my vegetable intake is less than optimal.Digestibility: I was initially concerned about potential digestive issues, as spirulina is quite high in fiber, but I've had no adverse effects. It seems to have actually contributed positively to my digestive health.Value: Given the density of nutrients and the amount of product you get, I find this spirulina powder to offer excellent value for money. It's an affordable and efficient way to supplement a healthy diet.Final Verdict: SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder has earned a permanent spot in my pantry. It's an easy, effective way to boost my nutritional intake, and I appreciate the versatility and health benefits it offers. For anyone looking to enhance their diet with a nutrient-rich superfood, I highly recommend giving this spirulina powder a try."

        "review_text": "California Gold Nutrition's St. John's Wort has been a welcomed addition to my daily wellness regimen, and it's quickly become a trusted companion in supporting my emotional well-being.\n\nOne of the standout features of this product is its European quality. EuroHerbs, known for their rigorous quality standards, have delivered a potent 300 mg dose of St. John's Wort in each of the 60 veggie capsules. This reassures me that I'm getting a reliable and effective product.\n\nSt. John's Wort is renowned for its potential to alleviate mild mood swings and promote emotional balance. I've personally found that this supplement has helped me maintain a more positive outlook on challenging days and provides a sense of inner calm.\n\nThe veggie capsules are easy to swallow and gentle on the stomach. I appreciate that they are suitable for vegetarians and vegans, making them accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of St. John's Wort can vary from person to person, and it may take a few weeks of consistent use to experience noticeable results. I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.\n\nOne minor drawback is that St. John's Wort can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's essential to take precautions when exposed to the sun. However, this is a known side effect of this herbal supplement and is not specific to this particular brand.\n\nIn summary, California Gold Nutrition St. John's Wort offers a natural and European-quality option for those seeking to support their emotional well-being. While it may not provide immediate results and should be used with caution, it's a worthwhile addition to a holistic approach to mental health. If you're looking for a natural mood booster, these veggie capsules are worth considering."

        "review_text": "California Gold Nutrition's St. John's Wort has been a welcomed addition to my daily wellness regimen, and it's quickly become a trusted companion in supporting my emotional well-being.\n\nOne of the standout features of this product is its European quality. EuroHerbs, known for their rigorous quality standards, have delivered a potent 300 mg dose of St. John's Wort in each of the 60 veggie capsules. This reassures me that I'm getting a reliable and effective product.\n\nSt. John's Wort is renowned for its potential to alleviate mild mood swings and promote emotional balance. I've personally found that this supplement has helped me maintain a more positive outlook on challenging days and provides a sense of inner calm.\n\nThe veggie capsules are easy to swallow and gentle on the stomach. I appreciate that they are suitable for vegetarians and vegans, making them accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of St. John's Wort can vary from person to person, and it may take a few weeks of consistent use to experience noticeable results. I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.\n\nOne minor drawback is that St. John's Wort can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's essential to take precautions when exposed to the sun. However, this is a known side effect of this herbal supplement and is not specific to this particular brand.\n\nIn summary, California Gold Nutrition St. John's Wort offers a natural and European-quality option for those seeking to support their emotional well-being. While it may not provide immediate results and should be used with caution, it's a worthwhile addition to a holistic approach to mental health. If you're looking for a natural mood booster, these veggie capsules are worth considering."

But with arginine supplements, only 1% can make through the stomach, intestines, and liver. Which is why you take L-Citrulline, of which 80% gets through because it bypasses the liver, and then converts to arginine. That's 80 times as much arginine naturally relaxing your blood vessels! Pine bark helps you use that arginine to make nitric oxide. The three highest sources of Procyanidins are Grape Seed Extract, Pine Bark and Pycnogenol. Proanthocyanin bioflavonoids are virtually identical whether they come from pine bark, grape seeds, lemon tree bark, cranberries, or hazel nut tree leaves. The difference is in the varying concentration in the different plant. Grape Seed Extract has the highest concentration of Proanthocyanin's, 95% concentration.
