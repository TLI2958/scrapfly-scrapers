If you are used to seeing the orange flavors of California Poppy, this one is a contradiction - where does purple come from amongst all of the warm-colored varieties that show off in reds, oranges, and yellows?  These poppies have a habit of opening and closing with the sun, appropriate for their native Golden State. The first member of the California poppy genus was identified in 1816 by German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso on an exploratory voyage to California and the Pacific Northwest. Chamisso named this genus \"Eschscholzia\" after a fellow botanist, Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, who accompanied him on the journey. Nearly a dozen species of poppy grow wild in the western United States.",

They are native to western North America and are one of the most well-known and popular wild flowers. Grow California Poppy in mass groupings for a stunning display of color. They also are perfect for naturalized landscape settings. Deadheading helps to encourage continuous blooms. If a few blooms are left to go to seed, these poppies are known for reseeding for next year’s display. Start the seed directly outdoors in a prepared seedbed in early spring. Press the seed into the soil and cover with 1/8 inch of soil. Keep the seed moist until germination. At a temperature of 60 - 70F, germination usually occurs within 28 days. Space the plants 12 inches apart. Grow in full sun and in well-drained soil. California Poppy is usually resistant to deer.",

Lighting up vast expanses of the springtime California mountains, they are probably the all-time favorite wildflower of the West. They can also be successfully grown as an annual in the Eastern US.  These golden wildflowers have been the state flower of California since 1903. Their habit of opening and closing with the sun makes them appropriate emblems for the Golden State; they also have a holiday all their own, since April 6 is official California Poppy Day. This poppy was the first identified member of the Eschscholzia genus, identified in 1816 by German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso on an exploratory voyage to California and the Pacific Northwest. Chamisso named the genus after a fellow botanist, Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, who accompanied him on the journey. In 1826, noted English botanist David Douglas gathered these California poppy seeds for the Royal Botanical Society; this poppy became one of the first American poppies to cross the ocean to Europe.",

Scatter the seeds broadly around the space. Walk over the seeds to press them into the ground.

This variety, Red Chief, is very lovely with red blooms, darker in the center and with orange at the edges. The foliage is bluish green and lacy. Grow California Poppy in mass groupings for a stunning display of color. They also are perfect for naturalized landscape settings. Deadheading helps to encourage continuous blooms. If a few blooms are left to go to seed, these poppies are known for reseeding for next year’s display. Start the seed directly outdoors in a prepared seedbed in early spring. Press the seed into the soil and cover with 1/8 inch of soil. Keep the seed moist until germination. At a temperature of 60 - 70F, germination usually occurs within 28 days. Space the plants 12 inches apart. Grow in full sun and in well-drained soil. California Poppy is usually resistant to deer.",

This plant grows to about 16 inche tall and are perfect for the wild flower meadow, flower garden or rock garden. When California Poppy seeds are planted in massive clusters, the visual appeal is amazing. These versatile flowers are also great as border plants around a group of larger flowering plants.

They are the same height and form as the common Orange California Poppy, but fired up with some extra heat and color! Adds some zing to an old favorite, and it is straightforward to grow.  These poppies have a habit of opening and closing with the sun, appropriate for their native Golden State. The first member of the California poppy genus was identified in 1816 by German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso on an exploratory voyage to California and the Pacific Northwest. Chamisso named this genus \"Eschscholzia\" after a fellow botanist, Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, who accompanied him on the journey. Nearly a dozen species of poppy grow wild in the western United States.",

The silky, cup-shaped flowers form on slender stems just like the common Orange California Poppy, but this shows off with many more colors. These poppies have a habit of opening and closing with the sun, appropriate for their native Golden State. The first member of the California poppy genus was identified in 1816 by German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso on an exploratory voyage to California and the Pacific Northwest. Chamisso named this genus \"Eschscholzia\" after a fellow botanist, Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, who accompanied him on the journey. Nearly a dozen species of poppy grow wild in the western United States.</p>",

      "description": "The California Poppy, <i>Eschscholzia californica</i>, graces many a sun-drenched meadow throughout California and the Southwest with its brilliant orange, saucer-shaped flowers. On bright days, the poppy's silky petals open to greet the sun. At dusk, the golden blooms close into tightly fluted repose. <i>Eschscholzia californica</i> was first described to the scientific community in the early 19th Century by a German naturalist, Adelbert von Chamisso. Since then, the flower has gained admirers the world-over, becoming the State Flower of California in 1890, and winning the hearts of gardeners everywhere with its welcoming beauty and the ease with which it grows.Always friendly and neat in appearance -- a popular flower to press -- the California Poppy features a compact, upright form, lifting its famous orange blooms 12 to 18 inches above a finely cut bed of lacy, bluish-green foliage. In milder climates that resemble its native California, the poppy is a perennial, blooming throughout the spring and summer, reseeding itself freely and generously. In colder regions, poppies must be reseeded by hand each spring in preparation for their summer colorburst. A swath of California Poppies brings a vivacious splash of color to virtually any open, sunny area, and they are as fun to grow as they are lovely! <p><b>What Poppies Like:</b> Poppies love dry and sunny places and well-drained, sandy soils. They are quite drought-tolerant, but don't like relentless high temperatures. Cool and sunny is their favorite combination. Water sparingly.</p><p><b>The Beauty of Poppies:</b> Poppies are very pretty in cottage gardens, rock gardens, and casually mixed into other wildflower plantings. They make a fantastic color accent, and thrive in most any open, sunny area. They are not at their best in small containers, and can be transplanted only when very young.</p> <p><b>When to Plant:</b> In colder climates, sow your seeds in early spring. In milder regions, plant poppies in fall. NOTE: In climates without cold, deep frosts in winter, poppies are perennial, re-seeeding themselves naturally and generously year after year!</p>",

Lighting up vast expanses of the springtime California mountains, they are probably the all-time favorite wildflower of the West. They can also be successfully grown as an annual in the Eastern US. These golden wildflowers have been the state flower of California since 1903. Their habit of opening and closing with the sun makes them appropriate emblems for the Golden State; they also have a holiday all their own, since April 6 is official California Poppy Day. This poppy was the first identified member of the Eschscholzia genus, identified in 1816 by German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso on an exploratory voyage to California and the Pacific Northwest. Chamisso named the genus after a fellow botanist, Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, who accompanied him on the journey. In 1826, noted English botanist David Douglas gathered these California poppy seeds for the Royal Botanical Society; this poppy became one of the first American poppies to cross the ocean to Europe.</p>",

The bright yellow-orange flowers and finely divided gray-green foliage of the California poppy look best when planted in large drifts, although it grows well even in crevices of rockeries. Flowers appear in spring and last throughout the summer. They are suitable for cutting but will close at night. Place flowers in water immediately after cutting. Plants grow 12-20 inches high and spread up to 20 inches. The plant is not suitable for the tropics, but will grow well in most other climates. It must have full sun and well-drained soil, but will tolerate poor soil. The flowers are solitary on long stems, silky-textured, with four petals, each petal 2–6 cm long and broad; their color ranges from yellow to orange, and flowering is from February to September. The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. The FLOWER is a slender, dehiscent capsule 3–9 cm long, which splits in two to release the numerous small black or dark brown seeds. It is perennial in mild parts of its native range, and annual in colder climates; growth is best in full sun and sandy, well-drained, poor soil. All seeds are packaged and for the current growing season All seeds are packaged and for the current growing season. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER SEED LISTINGS",

      "description": "California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Organic Dried Seeds Powder Liquid Extract, Golden Poppy, Herbal Supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California Poppy (Golden Poppy, California Sunlight, Cup of Gold) is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae, native to the United States and Mexico, and the official state flower of California. It is a perennial or annual growing to 5â60 in (13â152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Dry Seeds Powder.
