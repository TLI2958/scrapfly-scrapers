However, after reading about the presence of chemicals called lectins contained in greens such as wheat grass and barley grass, I decided to give this product a miss in the future. I am intolerant to gluten and this is a likely indicator that there may also be a lectin intolerance. After all, gluten is a lectin. This is something not many people know or understand. I was enlightened by Dr Gundry's work on lectins and after this point I make sure to choose carefully what greens, and even vegetables I eat, and I have been better for it. Just because I experienced stomach discomfort by taking wheat grass and barley grass, it doesn't mean you will too and it also doesn't mean that you will attribute your discomfort to the ingredients in this supplement.

Suitable for vegans and non-vegans. It has a high dosage of proteins and minerals. Not to mention its detoxifying effect like all green things. The flavor is obviously saline as it is always an alga.

Healing is never easy but it is a truly essential step to feeling good in your body.🍂 One thing that is also helping me is writing every day. Writing helps you lighten up and feel good. I understood this after a wonderful reading of a book: Everything will be fine I promise by Faouzi Zouhair. I recommend it because it allowed me to heal all my traumas and do internal work. 🍃 🍂 Healing the soul helps heal the body. For every healing journey you also need to work on your emotions. There are lots of videos and books out there that can help you do this.

The packaging of this product is simple and effective. The 8.5 oz (240 g) size is generous and provides a substantial amount of wheatgrass powder for its price. The resealable bag ensures that the powder remains fresh and dry, which is crucial for preserving its nutritional value.

The taste and texture of this wheatgrass powder are surprisingly pleasant. It has a slightly earthy and grassy flavor, which I found easy to incorporate into my morning routine. I usually mix it with water or blend it into my morning smoothie, and it blends well without clumping. There's a slight grittiness, but it's not overwhelming and doesn't affect the overall experience.

The nutritional benefits of wheatgrass are well-known, and this organic powder doesn't disappoint. It's packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, providing a natural energy boost and supporting overall health. I've noticed an increase in my energy levels and overall vitality since incorporating this into my daily regimen.

The fact that it's organic is a big plus for me, as I prefer products that are free from pesticides and chemicals. Knowing that I'm consuming a pure and natural source of wheatgrass makes me feel even better about my choice.

One downside is that the taste might not be for everyone. If you're not accustomed to green, earthy flavors, it might take some getting used to. However, the benefits far outweigh any initial hesitation in my opinion.

Another aspect to consider is the convenience factor. It's more convenient than juicing fresh wheatgrass, but it still requires some effort in mixing or blending. However, the trade-off between convenience and the health benefits is well worth it for me.

In conclusion, California Gold Nutrition's Organic Wheat Grass Powder is an excellent addition to a healthy lifestyle. It provides a natural energy boost, supports overall health, and is packed with essential nutrients. While the taste might not be everyone's favorite, the benefits make it a worthwhile choice for those looking to enhance their well-being with a superfood. I recommend giving it a try and experiencing the positive impact it can have on your health.",0.018,0.731,0.251,0.9985,positive

This brand is also known for high quality ingredients so getting this superfood on sale was an amazing deal. I'm still using my previous spirulina so I haven't tried this new one yet but I hope that this one is just a detoxing or even stronger with a better taste.

Spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, is famed for its impressive nutrient profile and health benefits. Here's my experience after incorporating this superfood into my routine for the past couple of months.Taste and Texture: Spirulina has a distinctive, somewhat ""fishy"" taste, which can be off-putting to some. However, when mixed into smoothies, juices, or even yogurts, its flavor becomes almost imperceptible. The powder itself is fine and blends well, although it does turn everything a deep shade of green.Nutritional Benefits: This spirulina powder is a nutritional powerhouse, rich in protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins), minerals (including iron and magnesium), and antioxidants. I started taking it to boost my energy levels and support my immune system, and I've definitely noticed a difference. My energy has been more consistent, and I've felt generally healthier and more resilient against common colds.Ease of Use: The powder format is incredibly versatile. I've experimented with adding it to various dishes and drinks. My favorite way to consume it is blended into a morning smoothie with fruits, which masks the taste while still delivering all the benefits.Effectiveness: It's hard to quantify the effect of any one supplement, but I can say that since adding spirulina powder to my diet, I've noticed an overall improvement in my energy and vitality.

I learned about the value of herbal cleanses; one such especially effective herbal regime may have saved my life. Over the years I have tried others but none of them have ever included Chanca Piedra as an ingredient. While cited as being especially targeted for addressing kidney and gallbladder issues, because of the close functional relationship between the healthy functioning of the gallbladder and liver, and having been a bit overdue for a kidney cleanse, I decided to try straight Chanca Piedra for the first time by purchasing the 16oz bottle. After taking the dosage regime recommended as a cleanse (as distinct from the more concentrated dosage specific to suffering from kidney stones, per se), I was so impressed with the results, I decided to immediately purchase a second 16 oz. bottle to use according to the twice-monthly maintenance dosage. If the safety and effectiveness of this CNPUSA product is any indication, I will certainly be a future customer of their liver cleanse and, intermittently, other products; almost certainly on a life-long basis.

One of the standout features of this product is its European quality. EuroHerbs, known for their rigorous quality standards, have delivered a potent 300 mg dose of St. John's Wort in each of the 60 veggie capsules. This reassures me that I'm getting a reliable and effective product.

St. John's Wort is renowned for its potential to alleviate mild mood swings and promote emotional balance. I've personally found that this supplement has helped me maintain a more positive outlook on challenging days and provides a sense of inner calm.

The veggie capsules are easy to swallow and gentle on the stomach. I appreciate that they are suitable for vegetarians and vegans, making them accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences.

It's important to note that the effectiveness of St. John's Wort can vary from person to person, and it may take a few weeks of consistent use to experience noticeable results. I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.

One minor drawback is that St. John's Wort can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's essential to take precautions when exposed to the sun. However, this is a known side effect of this herbal supplement and is not specific to this particular brand.

In summary, California Gold Nutrition St. John's Wort offers a natural and European-quality option for those seeking to support their emotional well-being. While it may not provide immediate results and should be used with caution, it's a worthwhile addition to a holistic approach to mental health. If you're looking for a natural mood booster, these veggie capsules are worth considering.",0.01,0.823,0.167,0.9931,positive

But with arginine supplements, only 1% can make through the stomach, intestines, and liver. Which is why you take L-Citrulline, of which 80% gets through because it bypasses the liver, and then converts to arginine. That's 80 times as much arginine naturally relaxing your blood vessels! Pine bark helps you use that arginine to make nitric oxide. The three highest sources of Procyanidins are Grape Seed Extract, Pine Bark and Pycnogenol. Proanthocyanin bioflavonoids are virtually identical whether they come from pine bark, grape seeds, lemon tree bark, cranberries, or hazel nut tree leaves. The difference is in the varying concentration in the different plant. Grape Seed Extract has the highest concentration of Proanthocyanin's, 95% concentration.
