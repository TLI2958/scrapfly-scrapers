The first member of the California poppy genus was identified in 1816 by German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso on an exploratory voyage to California and the Pacific Northwest. Chamisso named this genus ""Eschscholzia"" after a fellow botanist, Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, who accompanied him on the journey. Nearly a dozen species of poppy grow wild in the western United States.</p>",Everwilde Farms,4.5,8,https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/Everwilde-Farms-1000-Ballerina-Mixed-California-Poppy-Garden-Flower-Seeds-Gold-Vault-Jumbo-Bulk-Seed-Packet_5b11d8d3-bb5e-46cb-885c-d2826539d7e2_1.45a1cbefa453f99546566ad8d7142fef.gif,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Everwilde-Farms-1000-Ballerina-Mixed-California-Poppy-Garden-Flower-Seeds-Gold-Vault-Jumbo-Bulk-Seed-Packet/547544878,Queenie,"Aug 17, 2024",1 out of 5 stars review,No poppies,Not one single poppy in the whole bag,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,neutral

California Poppy  | Flower Seed Grow Kit | The Jonsteen Company,175021152,"The California Poppy, <i>Eschscholzia californica</i>, graces many a sun-drenched meadow throughout California and the Southwest with its brilliant orange, saucer-shaped flowers. On bright days, the poppy's silky petals open to greet the sun. At dusk, the golden blooms close into tightly fluted repose. <i>Eschscholzia californica</i> was first described to the scientific community in the early 19th Century by a German naturalist, Adelbert von Chamisso. Since then, the flower has gained admirers the world-over, becoming the State Flower of California in 1890, and winning the hearts of gardeners everywhere with its welcoming beauty and the ease with which it grows.Always friendly and neat in appearance -- a popular flower to press -- the California Poppy features a compact, upright form, lifting its famous orange blooms 12 to 18 inches above a finely cut bed of lacy, bluish-green foliage. In milder climates that resemble its native California, the poppy is a perennial, blooming throughout the spring and summer, reseeding itself freely and generously. In colder regions, poppies must be reseeded by hand each spring in preparation for their summer colorburst. A swath of California Poppies brings a vivacious splash of color to virtually any open, sunny area, and they are as fun to grow as they are lovely! <p><b>What Poppies Like:</b> Poppies love dry and sunny places and well-drained, sandy soils. They are quite drought-tolerant, but don't like relentless high temperatures. Cool and sunny is their favorite combination. Water sparingly.</p><p><b>The Beauty of Poppies:</b> Poppies are very pretty in cottage gardens, rock gardens, and casually mixed into other wildflower plantings. They make a fantastic color accent, and thrive in most any open, sunny area. They are not at their best in small containers, and can be transplanted only when very young.</p> <p><b>When to Plant:</b> In colder climates, sow your seeds in early spring.
