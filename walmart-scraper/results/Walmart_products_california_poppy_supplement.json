      "description": "California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Organic Dried Seeds Powder Liquid Extract, Golden Poppy, Herbal Supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California Poppy (Golden Poppy, California Sunlight, Cup of Gold) is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae, native to the United States and Mexico, and the official state flower of California. It is a perennial or annual growing to 5â60 in (13â152 cm) tall, with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage; flower color ranges from yellow to orange, with flowering from February to September in the northern hemisphere (spring, summer, autumn). The petals close at night or in cold, windy weather and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates. The California poppy was introduced into several regions with similar Mediterranean climates. It is commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, and was introduced to South Africa, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient: Organic California Poppy (Eschscholzia Californica) Dry Seeds Powder.

When the lymphatic system fails to flush contaminants effectively, it wraps them in fat and “super-glues” them under your skin, hips, thighs, and love handles. </p> <p> It also strains to absorb fluids and waste, resulting in puffiness, and swelling. In addition, your concentration and focus becomes scrambled, along with productivity and joy. </p> <p> The 8 superior quality ingredients in Lymph System Support by PureHealth Research work at the cellular level like “roto-rooter.”</p>",
