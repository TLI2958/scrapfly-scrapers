But thanks to this product, he  got rid of his fatty liver & bloating of his stomach in few months by just taking it. I also haven't stop taking it already for several months. It alleviates my lever issues owing to my age and occasional alcohol intake. I would like to recommend the product to all my acquaintances. "

Other things are there only for commertional, it dont even make 1% difference in my opinion, because there are too little amounts.

There is especially this odd sour taste that almost makes you gag, and which I never experienced in other brands. \n\nIf you really want to spot the difference, try the other brand that sources its Spirulina from India as well. That brand isn't the best either, but it is miles ahead of this one.\n\nThe awful taste makes you question could indicate quality issues, so I wonder if you really are getting the benefits you are supposed to be getting from Spirulina with this product? I bought two bags because of this product because usually California Gold products are of good quality, or at least decent. However in this case, I truly regret this purchase. Don't make the same mistake, pay a little more for that other brand that sources it from India."

        "review_text": "In my quest for a healthier lifestyle, I discovered SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder, 8.5 oz (240 g), and decided to integrate it into my daily nutrition. Spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, is famed for its impressive nutrient profile and health benefits. Here's my experience after incorporating this superfood into my routine for the past couple of months.Taste and Texture: Spirulina has a distinctive, somewhat \"fishy\" taste, which can be off-putting to some. However, when mixed into smoothies, juices, or even yogurts, its flavor becomes almost imperceptible. The powder itself is fine and blends well, although it does turn everything a deep shade of green.Nutritional Benefits: This spirulina powder is a nutritional powerhouse, rich in protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins), minerals (including iron and magnesium), and antioxidants. I started taking it to boost my energy levels and support my immune system, and I've definitely noticed a difference. My energy has been more consistent, and I've felt generally healthier and more resilient against common colds.Ease of Use: The powder format is incredibly versatile. I've experimented with adding it to various dishes and drinks. My favorite way to consume it is blended into a morning smoothie with fruits, which masks the taste while still delivering all the benefits.Effectiveness: It's hard to quantify the effect of any one supplement, but I can say that since adding spirulina powder to my diet, I've noticed an overall improvement in my energy and vitality. It's also been a great way to ensure I get a broad spectrum of nutrients in my diet, especially on days when my vegetable intake is less than optimal.Digestibility: I was initially concerned about potential digestive issues, as spirulina is quite high in fiber, but I've had no adverse effects. It seems to have actually contributed positively to my digestive health.Value: Given the density of nutrients and the amount of product you get, I find this spirulina powder to offer excellent value for money. It's an affordable and efficient way to supplement a healthy diet.Final Verdict: SUPERFOODS Organic Spirulina Powder has earned a permanent spot in my pantry. It's an easy, effective way to boost my nutritional intake, and I appreciate the versatility and health benefits it offers. For anyone looking to enhance their diet with a nutrient-rich superfood, I highly recommend giving this spirulina powder a try."
