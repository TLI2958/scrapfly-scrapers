Accidently, I received the Poppy Seed - Valerian Root to ensure better-quality sleep. Within minutes of my contact to ask how to return and switch teabags, I received an email telling me I could keep the valerian bags and received a very generous gift certificate. I cannot believe it. This is the first time I have ever received such a fast and amazing response. I have been up over 24hours because of my back pain. I brewed myself a cup of the Poppy-Valerian Seed tea and am relaxed and sleepy. What a wonderful product. I am hoping to replace Ambien with this tea and believe it is possible."

Accidently, I received the Poppy Seed - Valerian Root to ensure better-quality sleep. Within minutes of my contact to ask how to return and switch teabags, I received an email telling me I could keep the valerian bags and received a very generous gift certificate. I cannot believe it. This is the first time I have ever received such a fast and amazing response. I have been up over 24hours because of my back pain. I brewed myself a cup of the Poppy-Valerian Seed tea and am relaxed and sleepy. What a wonderful product. I am hoping to replace Ambien with this tea and believe it is possible."

This is the first time I have ever received such a fast and amazing response. I have been up over 24hours because of my back pain. I brewed myself a cup of the Poppy-Valerian Seed tea and am relaxed and sleepy. What a wonderful product. I am hoping to replace Ambien with this tea and believe it is possible."

This is the first time I have ever received such a fast and amazing response. I have been up over 24hours because of my back pain. I brewed myself a cup of the Poppy-Valerian Seed tea and am relaxed and sleepy. What a wonderful product. I am hoping to replace Ambien with this tea and believe it is possible."
