Great Company,"Haven't worked here long but so far seems they care about employees and work environment isn't tense like your typical call center. No work from home which is fine, I like interacting with my co-workers.They provide free food/snacks daily as well as coffee and beverages.","Honestly only disadvantage is the benefits package. You accrue time per pay period and you are penalized for using your sick time. I would recommend allowing employees to use sick time they have and only pentalize or give an occurence if they are out of time and call in sick. Also you should trust your employees. Most companies provide their employees their vacation allotment up front to plan out vacation year. Also 3 weeks vacation isnt competitive, every bank i worked for previously gave 4 weeks vacation with the option to purchase a additional week.overall Credit One is a growing company with great culture and people.",2024-10-05T06:34:31.303,,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,3.4,3.2,3.3,3.7

"Good people, less than good messaging","The people and environment are friendly depending on your department and team. Stable work, except they did lay off a ton of IT this year. Office is nice, but cafeteria literally hasn�t been functional for 3 years.","Senior management and HR is out of touch and contradictory. 
We had a department wide meeting discussing the employee survey and Glassdoor reviews in relation to other companies in our industry. We gloat that we are the best and the leader in our field. ALL other companies offer hybrid minimum. We actively compare ourselves to other companies to set our standards (salary, scheduling, holidays). Keep this in mind for the rest of the review. All these quotes came from senior management during this meeting regarding employee feedback via survey and Glassdoor.
�If you want hybrid, you need to do some soul searching�. However, when called out that we never seen them in office or �on the floor� they say �We are senior management. We are trust worthy, so we can work from home�. Alright. You don�t trust the employees then? 
There are complaints about not having certain holidays off. �We check other companies to see if enough of them take a holiday off. If it passes a threshold, we add it as a holiday�. We are suppose to be industry LEADERS and we can�t even give Veterans Day off unless other SMALLER companies do it first? 
All other smaller companies in our space are doing work from home, let�s follow that threshold and follow suit then! Make it make sense. 
�Senior management sees value in everyone working here, that�s why we didn�t just hire some offshore workers�. Gee thanks, that�s super nice to hear as a human being. Thank you for not outsourcing me. There are complaints about lack of promotion and career progression. �If turnover is higher, you have a higher chance of promotion�. Wow, we love retaining top talent right? By building a toxic work environment where we hope our coworkers leave so we have the slim chance of promotion. What we got from the employee survey response was 
1. We heard you, and don�t care
2. We don�t trust you to do your job
3. Promotions will not happen unless you cannibalize your coworkers
4. We compare our industry standards when it agrees with senior management, but if it doesn�t, let�s ignore the rest of the industry standards.
I know the response on here will say �just leave if you aren�t happy�. I get it. But also, employees are told to provide feedback in hopes of making a change to their workplace. What if I want to make my current workplace better? Does the employee voice not matter? What�s the point of the survey if everything is dismissed immediately? Do you not want people to stay? 
�We are not in the business of human suffering� said HR.

"Inspiring Leaders, Great Opportunities and Resources","While i wont be able to assess the entire company, based on my experiences in Risk. My tenure at the bank has been a positive one. The benefits of working in an employer of this size is that you are valued for your inputs on new projects and visions for the bank.

Pay structure is competitive with the overall market. Whether it is someone just joining or others that are more tenured in their profession, C1B remains a great place to work. Again, this is based on my time at RISK. Work life balance is great. benefits are competitive. 401k match is competitive.

"Get your foot in the door, then get out.","From a software engineer's perspective this is an excellent place to 'validate' your career and get started fresh out of college or if you're newly transitioning in to the field.

Other notable qualities include:
- Very clean office space located immediately off of the freeway

- Most people you'll run in to are friendly and collaborative

- Health, Medical, 401k, etc.

- Personal development scenarios such as taking classes or getting certifications are compensated

- Managers are aware the company pays below industry standards so they've made their interview processes much easier for technical roles.","Some of which include:
- No remote capabilities, you'll drive in to the office and join a teams call for 9/10 of your meetings.

- Your performance is irrelevant and there's little to no incentive to work hard. Your best chance at earning a promotion is by negotiating an offer letter from a new company or going to a new company after 6-12 months.

- From a software engineering standpoint the work will feel challenging, but not rewarding. The company utilizes older versions of enterprise software that will give you very little transferable knowledge. You will need to block out time for yourself and build upon your own personal development if you want individual growth.

- Severe lack of faith in senior management is widespread especially within technical positions.

- Company pays far below the standard for many of their positions, and in doing so the talent pool is smaller and turnover is much higher.
