This company is not what they seem.,"They pay well, provide meals &amp; snacks in hubs.","-Inaccessible leadership, even at director &amp; manager levels
-Confusing secrecy. There are problems with the way you are doing things, but we won't tell you exactly what the problems are, we'll occasionally change what the problems are, and we won't tell you where the feedback is coming from. 
-Retaliatory behavior. If you complain about the wrong person, even if that person is showing blatant disrespect or even illegally harassing you, their friends in management will retaliate
-Lack of organization. Projects can't get done because you can't get a consensus on getting them done. 
-Zero trust. You're not able to do your job unless multiple people approve every aspect. There is micromanaging at a level I've never seen before.
-There is a serious communication issue. You will not get the information you need or be told where what little information you have is coming from. You will then be told that you need to communicate better.",2025-02-06T09:24:51.950,,1,1,4,1,1,3,1,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL,4.3,4.1,4.3,4.5

"Great people, interesting product, relentless grind","- Kindest, smartest, and most talented co-workers you'll ever get to work with
- Interesting challenges to solve, which keep you on your toes always pushing the boundaries of your work
- Nice SF office, decent location
- Generous monthly stipend for caregivers and parents, which can be used for extracurricular activities, babysitters, educational resources, and more
- Personable CEO who makes an effort to know and acknowledge people in the company
- The company is profitable and doing well!
- A rocket ship that is adored by many","The company benefits and perks come at a price. The grind is real and is celebrated by execs. Be prepared to put in long hours, especially as major events like Config approach. Burnout is a common occurrence due to the intense workload. It's challenging to maintain a work-life balance and truly disconnect, as the company's ambitious nature demands constant focus on launching new features, updates, and hosting events at a rapid pace. These relentless working conditions are unsustainable in the long run. Compounding the issue, opportunities for career growth and upward mobility are limited, leaving employees feeling stagnant and facing a career plateau. You need to be extra proactive in advocating for yourself or else you'll just be swept away in the grind.",2024-05-08T09:47:52.500,Designer,3,2,3,3,5,5,4,,POSITIVE,4.3,4.1,4.3,4.5
Love the work and the people,"Great culture with collaboration and respect, amazing product, good leadership, lots of optimism for the future. I used to dread going to work in my past companies on Monday morning. At Figma, I find the projects and team mates interesting and want to go and work in the morning. Figma is also fully remote, which gives me more time to spend with family compared to being at the road in the Bay Area traffic. Coming from FANG companies, I found work place politics to be close to zero. Very high percentage of people try to do what is right for Figma, which is very refreshing.","No major complaints at all. When we see growing pains, leadership is generally quick to address them. Even though company is fully remote, if you want face time with others, the Hubs are not very close. For instance, in Bay Area, I have to commute to SF to see team mates. Luckily I do it only once or twice a month, which works fine. Would love to see more Hubs in the East Bay.",2024-06-06T07:03:18.213,Senior Software Engineer,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.1,4.3,4.5

"Awesome product, incredibly smart people, and lots to figure out","- This is by far the best product I've ever sold. The pure joy and excitement heard from customers truly inspires me to want to put my best foot forward. I strive to have the customer experience match the product experience. 
- People here care about their job and the people around them. From a sales Org, that can be rare in my experience. 
-Leadership cares, they know when things are tough and they honestly try and get to the root cause and figure out a solution. But as the company gets bigger this some times takes longer. 
- This job is more than just a quota, It's about wanting to better yourself and leadership constantly harps on wanting Figma to be a place we look back on and lean on all our learnings and experiences.","- Sure, quota can be tough at time. I won't lie, but show me a sales role where quota isn't a constant pain point. We're in sales and we live and die by quota. 
- Leadership has taken a lot of time to better evaluate how territories/books are cut. They have very recently adjusted our quota to not only be Net New ARR but also renewal ARR. This is a recent, and very welcomed shift, that rewards us for fighting customer churn, which previously wasn't the case.",2024-02-09T09:20:00.303,Account Executive,5,5,3,3,5,5,3,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.1,4.3,4.5
