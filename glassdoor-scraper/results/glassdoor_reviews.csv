50/50- You'll either like working here or not.,"1. Everyone is so welcoming! 
2. Pay is great, so negotiate well. 
3. Depending on who you'll report to, some Manager(s), Principal Investigator(s), and/or Core Head(s) are very understanding and fun and will support you.","1. You'll work for two Manager(s), Principal Investigator(s) and/or Core Head(s) who will require different things.
 
2. Not fully transparent- When I applied, the job posting stated it was a hybrid position. During my interview, all interviewers told me I could work from home any two days of my choosing. Once I got hired, I was told I had to wait six months before I could work from home. Once I reached the six-month mark, I was told that it was up to my main manager to decide whether or not I could work from home... my manager denied it. During the whole process, it seemed as if working from home was a definite thing I could do. There was no transparency during the interview. No one told me it was up to my supervisor to decide, and he did not want his admin to work from home (which HR knew since he told them).
