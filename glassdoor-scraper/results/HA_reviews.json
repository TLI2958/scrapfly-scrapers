Terrible Pay and Long Hours.","28":"Stepping stone","29":"Good for post grads"},"pros":{"0":"People are chill at night shift","2":"- Somewhat friendly people\n-office in central location","3":"Nice teams, a good place to develop the knowledge base of the use economic and financial data in industry.","4":"Good place to start right out of School to gain some work experience\r\nNice co-workers ready to help when you need it\r\nSome exposure to some key economic\/finance indicators based on the team you belong to\r\ngood health insurance\r\nCompany refunds for 1 class per semester (any tri state uni) if you get b or more","5":"Flexible hours for students and good for a first job.","6":"Great people that help each other","7":"this job will be a good stepping stone for your next opportunity","8":"Nothing i can recall , seriously","9":"Flexible hours nice environment Great Peopl","10":"Nice people and easy enough work.","12":"Relatively laid back work environment.  You can set your own schedule and take time off pretty much whenever you need time off.  Two weeks of fairly basic training.  Learning curve after that, but not too difficult to get over that hump.  Can't say anything about other DBMs, but the one I worked with was fairly hands-off and that ended up working well.","14":"Work from home (for now)\nGreat diversity. Multicultural, multilingual, large age spectrum, women leaders.\nExcellent benefits\nNice people\n(maybe a con) If you're an RA: you can be terrible at the software aspect of this job for a really long time and never actually get fired; we'll literally just hand you baby work every day and pay you a little bit more every 6 months.","15":"The learning curve to be decent\/good at what you're doing typically lasts between 2-3 months. Beyond that, you have an idea of what type of projects you'll mainly be working on, which provides security and some comfort going forward. It's a relatively casual work environment and the people who work there are, on a whole, very pleasant. For students, it's very convenient work, considering proximity to subways and general requirements to work between 20-30 hours. I really liked my supervisor.","16":"Good opportunity to learn Excel skills (Macro, Pivot Table, Vlookup, Functions etc.), how to gather large data sets and process them. Casual atmosphere. People here are willing to help (if you ask for)","17":"Because a lot of other companies use the Haver database it is good to have on your resume.","18":"Great people within the teams, a very relaxed working environment, and a central Manhattan location.","20":"Great environment with very helpful supervisors that will assist you along the way. Flexible with school!","21":"easy, chill, nice office, nice people","22":"- Great coworkers - Not too difficult of a job","23":"Good work life balance Helpful and smart colleagues","24":"Best place to get your feet wet after a huge pile of rejection","25":"Everyone is super kind and understanding, great diversity, great place to jump start your career","26":"A decent part-time opportunity for recent graduates and those who want to split time between work and graduate school.\n\nYou can pick your hours, working between 20-40 hours per week on your designated shift.\n\nA really easy job to do when you are working remotely.","27":"Can work remotely. Don't need to commute every day in this pandemic.\r\nGood experience to start off career. Somewhat a recognizable name in the industry. Not a big name though.\r\nCoworkers are nice and chill here.\r\nGood Insurance.","28":"Easy laid back atmosphere , chill people","29":"Chill work, great coworkers, decent benefits"},"cons":{"0":"Does not have much career prospect","2":"-Compensation does not match cost of living in NYC\n-endless work\n-Poor relations between management and staff\n-No company culture","3":"pay is not at industry level for a NYC based non remote company. \nNo Career progression.","4":"Not a place for someone who values career growth and skillset mobility. \r\nVirtually no upward mobility\r\nSalary is very uncompetitive. \r\nLong hours (8.5) hours excluding lunch break. 9.5 hrs per day. \r\nNo transferable technical skills other than excel and limited python\/vba\/command prompt batch files\r\nPay is based on tenure and not skillset. Starts at 50-53k and increases by 5-8 % average per year. \r\nVery limited vacation days and vacations are earned, i.e. no vacations for the first 6 months of your employment as a full time employee.\r\nFor people on h1b, don't expect company to sponsor your green card.","5":"Gets very mundane and uninteresting. Lack of culture in the workplace.","6":"Pay and can get pretty boring after learning the basics","7":"you can end up with bad hours, no upward mobility","8":"Salary , micro management, and shifts","9":"Boring Work Sometimes feeling rushed dated system","10":"Sometimes the work can be done quickly.","12":"Can get boring and monotonous at times.  Little room for growth and development if your background does not align well with economics.  Upper management seems to be cracking down on little things that are insignificant to productivity.  The short courses are not very useful.","14":"Old school software and management style\nHigh turnover on certain shifts: workload can fall on you when someone leaves\noffice politics: being likable gets you just as far as being good at your work\ndatabase\/management quality is uneven across teams","15":"Almost all feedback that you receive will pertain to making a mistake. While there's definitely some perk to seeing your work reflect directly onto the database, you learn to settle for not hearing complaints from management as affirmation as good work. Some tasks are extremely tedious and don't feel like time is being well-spent.","16":"Lag of employees' empowerment. You kind of have to wait for senior managers to help you or you figure out how to do the job on your own but you can't really make a decision on the process. Friendly and easy environment. Casual and can be too casual. Not really a business professional environment that you're looking for.","17":"Horrible pay for the amount of work you do. Tasks aren't distributed evenly. some people do nothing all day and get paid the same as people who are working very hard. Kinda feels like high school as some DBMs only encourage and help the SRAs they have good relationships with.","18":"Management needs a total shake down. The leadership from the top down is trying to play both sides for a CEO who inexplicably wants things to not change in a data company in the 21st century. For example if a complaint is raised about the unnecessary morning meetings and potential changes that can be made to it, that line of thinking is immediately shut down.","20":"I can\ufffdt think of a con right now.","21":"limited exit option. low pay","22":"Being there from 8am - 6 pm felt like too long. No room for growth","23":"Low pay No room for advancement","24":"Night hours and low salary","25":"Monotonous work, low pay, not a lot of room for career growth, outdated technology, all the technical skills you learn are company-specific and not transferable to other jobs at other companies","26":"Seniority does not matter. I worked under a database manager for 2 years. About a year and a half in he announced he was leaving, I applied for his position and did not even receive a second interview.\n\nVery monotonous work. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are looking for enjoyment in your job, this isn't the type of work to do. \n\nYou are judged based on the mistakes you made. If you are responsible for Client Problem Reports and receive average performance reviews, you will not be looked upon as a valued employee.\n\nThe hours, they stink. On the Asian and Euro shifts, you must adjust your life pretty dramatically to accommodate for these working hours.\n\nNo room for growth. Even if you do get a DBM job, you will probably be stuck in that position for a while, and you can't advance within the company.","27":"Terrible pay: Salary and bonus here are ridiculously low. Salary for new DBM , ADBM and tech person is less than 60K, pre tax! Some are even around 50K. Research assistants are only paid $15 per hour or the minimum wage. All these people should get a salary raise. I don't think people can live an average life in NYC with 40K-50K after tax. It is not surprising at all that the turnover rate is high in this company. It is funny that you can get $900 unemployment benefit per week from gov if you lose your job in NYC, but less than $900 per week after tax if working for Haver.\r\n\r\nLong Hours: 9 hours every day with a 1 hour break. Day shift even works longer. There is Asian shift from 4 pm to 1 am and a European shift working from 1 am to 10 am! Working nights could be killing health and normal social life. But night shifts only get quite a little compensation for that. Sometimes people have to work on weekends with low compensation.","28":"No growth . stagnation \/ repetitive workload. Low salary","29":"Salary on the lower end"},"review_date":{"0":"2025-01-12T16:35:04.873","2":"2024-04-02T12:43:16.783","3":"2024-01-10T06:43:18.443","4":"2022-05-23T18:44:40.363","5":"2023-09-26T15:40:53.797","6":"2023-08-10T17:35:07.203","7":"2023-07-25T23:50:35.367","8":"2023-10-02T19:34:15.707","9":"2023-05-10T09:54:20.370","10":"2022-06-28T04:28:14.053","12":"2014-12-07T16:16:59.573","14":"2021-07-22T07:47:22.207","15":"2015-02-21T11:47:34.670","16":"2014-07-09T14:52:26.527","17":"2015-01-15T18:51:45.233","18":"2019-03-15T07:43:49.927","20":"2023-01-18T15:21:44.160","21":"2023-02-15T20:41:09.647","22":"2022-12-23T08:03:37.893","23":"2022-12-16T12:19:25.547","24":"2022-09-27T14:46:51.243","25":"2022-06-02T20:15:49.990","26":"2021-09-01T16:02:11.527","27":"2021-02-05T21:12:19.877","28":"2022-09-29T23:14:34.503","29":"2022-07-13T18:41:52.967"},"job_title":{"0":"Research Assistant","2":"EDM","3":"Economic Database Manager","4":"Database Manager","5":"Research Assistant","6":"Research Analyst","7":"Database Manager","8":"Database Manager","9":"Research Assistant","10":"Economics Research Assistant","12":"Senior Research Assistant","14":"International Database Manager","15":"Research Assistant","16":"Economic Research Assistant","17":"SRA","18":"Database Manager","20":"Research Intern","21":"Research Assistant","22":"Technical Support Analyst","23":"Sales","24":"Research Assistant","25":"Economics Research Assistant","26":"Economic Research Assistant","27":"Database Manager","28":"Research Assistant","29":"Database Manager"},"rating_overall":{"0":5,"2":2,"3":2,"4":2,"5":3,"6":3,"7":4,"8":1,"9":3,"10":4,"12":4,"14":3,"15":4,"16":3,"17":2,"18":2,"20":5,"21":4,"22":4,"23":3,"24":5,"25":3,"26":2,"27":1,"28":1,"29":3},"rating_work_life_balance":{"0":5,"2":5,"3":2,"4":3,"5":4,"6":0,"7":4,"8":1,"9":0,"10":4,"12":0,"14":4,"15":0,"16":3,"17":3,"18":5,"20":5,"21":0,"22":0,"23":5,"24":3,"25":3,"26":3,"27":1,"28":3,"29":0},"rating_compensation_and_benefits":{"0":1,"2":2,"3":2,"4":1,"5":2,"6":0,"7":2,"8":1,"9":0,"10":3,"12":0,"14":5,"15":0,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"20":3,"21":0,"22":0,"23":3,"24":3,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":2,"29":0},"rating_career_opportunities":{"0":1,"2":2,"3":2,"4":1,"5":2,"6":0,"7":2,"8":1,"9":0,"10":3,"12":0,"14":3,"15":0,"16":1,"17":4,"18":1,"20":5,"21":0,"22":0,"23":3,"24":3,"25":2,"26":2,"27":3,"28":1,"29":0},"rating_culture_and_values":{"0":5,"2":1,"3":3,"4":1,"5":2,"6":0,"7":1,"8":1,"9":0,"10":5,"12":0,"14":4,"15":0,"16":2,"17":2,"18":2,"20":5,"21":0,"22":0,"23":3,"24":3,"25":5,"26":3,"27":2,"28":2,"29":0},"rating_diversity_and_inclusion":{"0":5,"2":1,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":0,"7":4,"8":1,"9":0,"10":5,"12":0,"14":5,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"20":5,"21":0,"22":0,"23":4,"24":3,"25":5,"26":5,"27":5,"28":5,"29":0},"rating_senior_leadership":{"0":1,"2":1,"3":2,"4":1,"5":4,"6":0,"7":2,"8":1,"9":0,"10":4,"12":0,"14":3,"15":0,"16":2,"17":1,"18":3,"20":5,"21":0,"22":0,"23":3,"24":3,"25":3,"26":1,"27":3,"28":2,"29":0},"rating_recommend_to_friend":{"0":null,"2":"NEGATIVE","3":"NEGATIVE","4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":"POSITIVE","8":null,"9":null,"10":"POSITIVE","12":"POSITIVE","14":"POSITIVE","15":null,"16":"POSITIVE","17":"NEGATIVE","18":"NEGATIVE","20":"POSITIVE","21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":"NEGATIVE","26":"NEGATIVE","27":"NEGATIVE","28":null,"29":null},"rating_business_outlook":{"0":null,"2":"NEUTRAL","3":"POSITIVE","4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":"NEUTRAL","8":null,"9":null,"10":"POSITIVE","12":null,"14":"NEGATIVE","15":null,"16":"NEUTRAL","17":"NEGATIVE","18":"NEGATIVE","20":"POSITIVE","21":null,"22":null,"23":"NEUTRAL","24":null,"25":"NEUTRAL","26":"NEGATIVE","27":"NEGATIVE","28":null,"29":null},"overall_rating":{"0":3.3,"2":3.3,"3":3.3,"4":3.3,"5":3.3,"6":3.3,"7":3.3,"8":3.3,"9":3.3,"10":3.3,"12":3.3,"14":3.3,"15":3.3,"16":3.3,"17":3.3,"18":3.3,"20":3.3,"21":3.3,"22":3.3,"23":3.3,"24":3.3,"25":3.3,"26":3.3,"27":3.3,"28":3.3,"29":3.3},"compensation_and_benefits_rating":{"0":2.6,"2":2.6,"3":2.6,"4":2.6,"5":2.6,"6":2.6,"7":2.6,"8":2.6,"9":2.6,"10":2.6,"12":2.6,"14":2.6,"15":2.6,"16":2.6,"17":2.6,"18":2.6,"20":2.6,"21":2.6,"22":2.6,"23":2.6,"24":2.6,"25":2.6,"26":2.6,"27":2.6,"28":2.6,"29":2.6},"culture_and_values_rating":{"0":3.2,"2":3.2,"3":3.2,"4":3.2,"5":3.2,"6":3.2,"7":3.2,"8":3.2,"9":3.2,"10":3.2,"12":3.2,"14":3.2,"15":3.2,"16":3.2,"17":3.2,"18":3.2,"20":3.2,"21":3.2,"22":3.2,"23":3.2,"24":3.2,"25":3.2,"26":3.2,"27":3.2,"28":3.2,"29":3.2},"diversity_and_inclusion_rating":{"0":3.8,"2":3.8,"3":3.8,"4":3.8,"5":3.8,"6":3.8,"7":3.8,"8":3.8,"9":3.8,"10":3.8,"12":3.8,"14":3.8,"15":3.8,"16":3.8,"17":3.8,"18":3.8,"20":3.8,"21":3.8,"22":3.8,"23":3.8,"24":3.8,"25":3.8,"26":3.8,"27":3.8,"28":3.8,"29":3.8}}
