Made me work on a wide range of tech skills which I did not think I needed to know. I Joined them after thinking after a long time as they were expensive. \n\nMy mistake -I joined another place which was cheaper and paid them $10,000 and wasted 5 months of time and after that the bootcamp which had promised me a lot could not get me a single interview. You know I am talking about you Dojo.\n\nAt Synergisticit the Projects, the tech experience I received was very important to help me transition into a data scientist position.\n\nI stayed with them for almost 9 months and had 33 screenings and 11 interviews. The Job market was tough, and I had my friends who were from my school who could not even get a single interview however me being with synergisticit made a lot of difference\nI got experience as a data scientist, a data analyst, a BI analyst and somewhat as a ML engineer. \n\nafter 9 months 10 days I am working as a Jr data scientist at a company with great benefits and hopefully good growth and a salary of $105,000","2":"Good Training Practices with excellent mentors.","3":"NOTHING I HATE THIS COMPANY","4":"great place for improving and learning","5":"good company with good people","6":"the training is better than other companies","7":"1. Adequate and thorough training of fundamentals of programming.\n2. Working on real life situation projects to prepare you for the real job projects.\n3. Very helpful and understanding trainers.\n4. Great support from the management and all other departments.\n5. A great job placement rate.\n\nNOTE: Being an OPT Student it can be so challenging to get a job but SynergisticIT helped me get a job within 2 months which is something that I am so grateful for. Thank you guys I am so grateful.","8":"If you don't have enough knowledge and experience or you just can't focus on one thing, they'll help you. My trainers were very good and I am absolutely sure that the risk was worth taking. Everyone among my teammates got their foot in IT.","9":"Writing this review to give feedback as i owed synergisticit this .\r\n\r\ngood organization to get down and dirty on skills required by google, apple, visa ..... After being with synergisticit  i had 3 offers in 2.5 weeks and rather than clients choosing me i could turn tables on them and pick and choose clients rather than waiting by the phone and refreshing emails waiting to hear from them\r\n\r\ni joined synergisticit almost 1.5 years back and during my time with them had opportunity to work on projects involving core java , advanced java , full stack technologies like angularjs, node.js and mongodb . Most of other firms which are bootcamps dont do 30% of what they do .\r\n\r\nAll in all after being with them and working on projects made me competent enough that i was able to move to secure a position at apple cupertino . I was with synergistic people for almost 6 months and it was a long process which was a stepping stone to my eventual success of getting an opportunity to work at apple.\r\n\r\nYou will work long and hard and get tired at times also . End result as earlier reviews say is great.  I give 2 thumbs up to them . listen to them and follow their process and you will get success. Dont rush stuff. After doing projects that's not enough you need to prepare yourself and they also give you tons of coding work which prepares you for other clients","10":"nothing fancy about this place but at least for me synergisticit was da best place for tech skills improvement \/learning technologies related to java and full stack programming. \r\nfriends and alumni of mine are still struggling to find good jobs and i had 2 offers withing 3 weeks of completion of my tenure with synergisticit. I have 30+ people who i know  who got free training , got paid training and some also paid for training and were either locked down for 2 years with the firm paying them low money and in some cases they learnt nothing and were once again had to struggle for finding a job.\r\nopportunities after being with synergisticit and doing projects multiplied 10 x and i was not restricted in whioch organization i could join and had full freedom\r\n\r\nhated doing my projects and understanding things at time --tough love as you might say --after everything done i look back at my time spent here as valuable.\r\n\r\nreceived offers with google and Apple both long term gigs and am happy and satisfied as earlier not even startups looked at my profile.\r\n\r\ni read some reviews where someone posted fake and fraud. to anyone considering synergisticit simple acid test is go into their office and ask them to show you people placed in the past 3-6 months . If they cannot show you anything then its fake which i can tell personally is not true and the entity or person posting these bad reviews is either a joke or a scam.\r\n\r\nThis coming from a person who has first hand experience. If anyone needs any answers ask me and work permitting i will answer them. I bring this up as i wanted to write a positive review and then saw these negative reviews and could not take it sitting down as an alumni.\r\n\r\nAll in all no other firm came close and this coming from a person who did not just want a job but something which made him recession proof","11":"1.) You learn to listen or pretend to listen to the many lectures of management.\r\n2.) You learn to work hard, so that you can get out of there as quickly as possible\r\n3.) You do learn Spring and Hibernate, but then again there is YouTube","12":"decent place to learn java and.net .good big name clients in their network which I did not have access to.\r\nh1 approved this month after rfe done premium. everiifed \r\nother things same like resume. payments received on time. been with them for 3 years now","13":"The training was really good. It is highly sturctured . They have good marketing team and the best of all is that they never missed one payments .\r\nI would say that their training is excellent. I would recommend this place for freshers. It is more that whta you pay for it.","14":"Very Good java training and good client base for java. Nice facilities with clean guest houses and a simple but efficient lunch room. Lots of coding and practicals and small projects which make you learn and remember what you learned. Interview prepperation is good","15":"Synergisticit has very good traniners and marketing team.They provide endless hours of training.\r\nIts hard to find a very good trainer in these days.They would clarify your doubts \"n\" number of times.\r\nThe marketing manager is really good at it. We have presentations evey day single day till we get it right and they support you after your project.","16":"i joined them in 2012 after finishing my MS \r\nI had interviewed at 20 clients for full time jobs and was rejected even though i had a 3.7 GPA and with a MS in computer science.\r\n\r\n I joined a consulting company in New Jersey cant name it but starts with V and has software in name .gave notes set of questions and a resume and i started having interviews ..interviews which were taken by someone else. \r\n\r\nThey told me to go to a small client and i worked there for 3 weeks  and was fired as i had no training which i was promised.\r\n\r\nJoined another consulting co. in atlanta georgia same problem very poor training and nothing just notes and small orientation for 3 -5 days and some weekend classes . placed once more at another client and someone took interview for me and once again i was fired by client in 10 days.\r\n\r\nI was very demotivated and planning to go back to India. i was recommended synergistic by my cousin who stays in bay area stating that she took training from them. on her recommendation i joined them and to my surprise their training was 1000 times better than any training which i took.\r\ni cleared my own client interview and it took me 4 interviews to get a job and they took personal interest in me and my life and my future which was a welcome change. \r\n\r\nI felt confident when i joined the client . A client in LA rhymes with jamgem one of big healthcare clients i worked there for 3 years they did my h1b after 6 months i got an rfe and they had their attorney fight it and got it answered an my h1b was approved. I worked with them for 2 years on h1b and now i am at a entertainment giant in LA which employs ducks and mouse and has theme parks. \r\n\r\n\r\nI referred 5 of my friends to them all of them now working at fortune 200 clients .  i have had many people lie to them and cheat them i have never seen them do the same to anyone\r\nLong story short i was foolish when i was young and got influenced by my classmates and other consulting companies and wasted 4 months of my life if i would have joined synergistic before i could have been on project earlier . I do thank my cousin and synergisticit people for making me what i am today. most consulting people lie to get you in sign a contract its only some who arestand by their word . I was given same course content by all only synergisticit actually taught me what was mentioned in course content practically\r\n\r\nThey are honest people and dont lie like other consulting companies. I know for a fact that there are so many consulting companies which provide training taking nothing but only synergisticit takes docs and deposits and even then people join them. if you are taken by them you are guaranteed a project i am proof of that.","18":"have worked with them for 3.6 years now and they have stood by me in thick and thin when i was almost out of status they helped me remain in status. they expect you to remain with them for 1 year after you get your h1b approval . i have know my own batch people who have used and manipulated them till date i have not seen them doing anything harmful to anyone. after people manipulating them they bought changes to their contracts . Training is good and marketing was excelent when i took training. They have best intentions for their employees .\r\n\r\ni read lots of recent bad reviews and i doubt their authenticity and question the people writing the reviews if they ever had experience with any other consulting firm and if they are aware how other consulting companies operate. i read them being greedy and going for higher rates ...i highly doubt it as i know their priority is more towards longer projects and i have seen people being sent to longer projects even though when getting lower rates. my upbringing taught me to be thankful to people who help you and never forget them and for synergistic people did that.\r\ni dont know if they write their own reviews but most of which is written in positive reviews is true and i can attest to it..whatever i read in negative reviews seems to be borne out of frustration, sarcasm and vengeance rather honest review and feedback..i wonder the psych of people writing those reviews and how successful they have been as they dont seem to be very people friendly and one thing i learnt during my experience is your interpersonal skills, being emphatic, friendly and having a good personality helps you more than your coding skills and believe me on that \r\n\r\n i know other consulting firms stuffing 9 people in a 2 bedroom apartment, proxy interviews and printout of questions given in the form of training. reason i can say this is because i myself was subjected to such consulting firms before i joined synergisticit and at least they treat you like human beings. i being more experienced now know that they earned money from me in first year at the same time they spent a lot of money on me too. after first year they put me on percentage and i made more money than my colleagues in full time positions and i am putting this rview down as i intend to move on to a real big company which i always wanted to join which is headquartered in mounatin view and i want to say path was not easy but journey was enjoyable","19":"- As long as you work hard, you will be able to grow your software developer skillset here, expanding upon your career options and to find many opportunities that are available, especially now that Covid is starting to subside companies will hire more\r\n- The trainers will help you and are very helpful and responsive, being thorough in what they teach\r\n- Teaches you skills that are highly relevant in the current IT industry\r\n- Was able to receive multiple offers from companies in the span of 2-3 weeks","20":"Great place to start your new career; learn a lot of new technologies; they train you very well both front end and backend;","21":"You get to work in various industries.","22":"Great Place to learn\nLots of variety in work\nGet out what you put in","23":"very thorough in their approach to what i learnt at Synergistic. Had hands on experience to tech which i would not have been able to get elsewhere.\r\nvalue which i gained by being here was comparable to something which will take me 3-4 times longer to achieve elsewhere. I could leverage the experience at synergisticit to move onto a another client based on the projects done here. \r\nit may be intense at times for some people but the achievements after everything when the dust settles around you , the sweat and the grime pays off.  I had calls from revature, was considering hackreactor\/Galvanize but these people had the best word of mouth from people i had spoken to. The best thing was that i could work remotely if i wanted to and could come onsite if i wanted to which helped a lot.\r\n$95 Grand  was my offer after finishing with Synergisticit and that is wonderful for a guy who companies did not even consider emailing back before joining synergisticit guys.\r\nthe people and programmers\/trainers who you work with are excellent with deep knowledge . some might have some strong accents but not something which you wont be able to understand.","24":"Everything is good, Great work environment, Zero work pressure and Good culture.","25":"good work culture,flexible work hours","26":"I am really happy that I was a part of Synergisticit as a consultant. The training was really good. I used to attend 5 hours of training in a day and after that we used to work together till 5 in the evening on our assignments. The batches were small and all of the batchmates were very focused so it was esy for us to get a project. \r\nThe marketing team also did a good job. We get calls till we join the client site.\r\nGreat guest house. Everything was taken care off.","28":"Synergisticit is known for its java placement. It is really very hard to get into the training batch. They screen you in and out before they take you. Once you are in the training there is no looking back. I had to put in like 4-6 hours of extra work and they go me a project exactly in the 10th week as promised.Their interview preparation classes are really great. Absolutely fantastic marketing team with good client base, batches are small, one on one with the trainers towards the end, Good collection of books for java.","29":"Good coverage of different technologies. i heard good things about them and experienced it myself. people previously who were unable to find jobs in startups after getting experience with synergisticit got offers from apple, paypal, intel .\r\n\r\ngood place for people with basic understanding of programming in java or any other language and people with experience. If you dont know any programming dont join as you will have a hard time as there is projects which you have to do etc and a solid foundation is needed in basic programming.\r\n\r\n if you have a good foundation are a good student i assure you they will make you succeed. I have seen average pay rates after working with them something in the range of 75k to as high as 130k i guess that also depends if you had previous experience how well you present yourself and stuff.\r\n\r\n They work with you and the manger is also supportive and would tell you things good for you but you might not like them. If you are rude you will be called out, dont come to office same. You can do projects remotely also as long as you do are regular and dont miss days.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to say that i was able to get couple of offers within 3 week of finishing my projects with them and they putting me into the market. I after 5 months know almost 3 times more than my peers before i joined synergisticit what they told me that what you learn here in 5 months people take 4-5 years to learn is almost true to a certain extent. \r\n\r\nI am witness to one person who used to drive uber to supplement his income and after working with synergisticit he is working for paypal now and getting 100+k. To anyone thinking about coming over to them just have confidence work hard and stay positive and be regular and i promise you that very soon you will be working at a great client and will have multiple offers rather than just one. \r\nI am living proof for the above. Anyone needs any answers message me here and i will try to answer. It took me 4 months to write this review and it was long due and i guess i owed them this. \r\n\r\nWas giving 4 stars but decided for 5 stars as even though they are not structured the end result is what counts and that was me getting more stronger technically and me in being demand by multiple clients. I wish good luck to everyone.. god bless"},"cons":{"0":"pace is a little bit slow","1":"Investment and duration may not be for everyone.\nAlso they only offer data science and Java programs","2":"Old way of solving problems.","3":"Every single tech position is saturated with these \"job listings\", if I wanted to pay 10k to get a job I would go back to school. It should be illegal for companies offering no real job like this to post on job boards. STOP IT!! You are congesting job boards. It needs to stop.","4":"not too much space for promotion","5":"not from my work experience","6":"training contract is strict . I had to pay them 18000 as settlement and 4000 in their lawyer charge and every month I am paying them 2000 dollars out of my paycheck. I had taken training and went on project and then left without finishing the 1 year contract which they had made me sign. they have same terms in training contract and in the other contract which they make you sign when you get project which is 25000 $ . if you join them and bypass them , take training and run away or join project and leave in middle of project . they send some emails  from their account and if you pay the penalties then it is fine if not their lawyer sends  notice, then court notice. I even had changed my phone and address somehow the lawyer still caught hold of me and sent letters to my new place and to my email and workplace. I hired a lawyer but he was charging 5000 for the case and said you will have to pay so I settled with them. I feel I should not have joined them or should have completed my contract as I am still paying through my nose for a small mistake. I cannot take manager name as glassdoor will not let me take his name he did not show me any mercy when I explained I don't have any money to pay for contract violation. good thing is I have a job presently to pay them otherwise I would be on road if it was left to them","7":"None I can think of.","8":"Although the trainings are remote, you can't combine them even with any other part time job - sometimes you have no time for lunch. No life-work balance at all for the duration of the program (almost 10 months)","9":"sometimes technologies might be overwhelming and you feel or have self doubt whether you really know stuff.. when i interviewed at other clients i had 3 offers in 15 days so i guess i did know stuff","10":"longer than anticipated took me 4 months as i had to take certifications for java 8 which took me 1.5 months.","11":"1.) No in house internet, oh and no furnishing -> Sleeping bags on the floor + 5 people in an apartment on average\r\n2.) Constant surveillance, be it via tracking ip or via cameras in the office (which is why there is no internet in the apartment) or HR listening in to your conversations\r\n3.) Given a stipend in the form of gift cards, but only for those close to the office as management is too lazy to travel 5 min by car to pick them up from better grocery stores\r\n4.) Management doesn't trust candidates\r\n5) Also training takes 4 to 5 months, so if there are better alternatives please take them.","12":"hectic training schedule. no remote training. they only take selective people and their training contract is tough and they enforce it through collection agencies if someone does not adhere to the contract","13":"The training would look like like too much. I had to work really hard. Too many interviews lined up. I did not even get time to look into the requirements.","14":"Contract is pretty tough and they litigate through attorneys on violation. I know someone in my batch who paid 10 k on violation and 4 k in attorney fees when he tried to walk away from the contract and get a job on his own after taking training","15":"Sometimes the training is a little slow. During maketing we are submitted to \"n\" number of client and at one point it gets really hard for us to take so many interviews in one day.","16":"training goes for almost 8-10 weeks at the same time i dont blame them as java is too extensive and we did projects which helped me clear interviews and survive on projects.","18":"contract which they have is strict and i came to know now they made more changes to enforce compliance if someone tries to leave before 1 year of getting placed or leaving after training. i came to know as someone who was in the batch after me contacted me as someone contact him about getting out of the contract and leaving in middle and had been sent court notice by their employment attorney and he had to travel from nj to california for court appearance and had to finally pay the contract violation and attorney fee which were like 30k which he was paying in installments otherwise his immigration situation would have been in trouble due to a civil and court proceedings showing up on his background check and his immigration documents. my advice is to just do a 1 year employment and then move on if you want to explore greener pastures to be on safe side as work is stressful and then court hearings are even worse. traing may be tough for electric or other backgrounds so join if you have coding background otherwise you will be in training for 4-5 months","19":"- depending on your level of experience, it can take some time to get you ready for the market\r\n- webex tool is primarily used for trainer to candidate communication though its stability can vary from time to time","20":"Nothing I have to say","21":"There are no cons that I can think of.","22":"Very intense\nNeed to be dedicated\nHard to catch up if you slack similar to school","23":"some strong but understandable accents but all of it really helped me learn many things once i got comfortable as their experience trumped the accent","24":"Nothing is bad all these things is manage properly.","25":"not much to say about improvements","26":"1)The technical screening is very hard. So its not even easy to get into their training. \r\n2) The training is not easy - 5 hours of training and after that we have to put in 4 hours.\r\n3)Marketing is super fast. All you do in a day is to talk with clients and vendors.","28":"Sometimes I feel the training is a little slow, but they spend extra hours on the weekend.\r\nAs others said i got way to many calls in the second week of my marketing which I personally could not handle.","29":"there is no planned structure only in the end all the pieces come together. Duration is pretty long as much as 4-5 months but i feel the topics covered are so many that it makes sense that it takes that much time. Good for people with basic knowledge and experienced people with no US experience . People who dont know coding will have tough time and will have to work long hours to compete"},"review_date":{"0":"2024-02-16T17:31:27.187","1":"2024-11-23T18:23:04.130","2":"2024-09-25T10:13:58.967","3":"2024-06-12T14:33:45.533","4":"2023-12-29T12:51:11.553","5":"2023-11-28T14:47:30.343","6":"2016-02-09T22:06:42.853","7":"2022-08-17T13:28:53.993","8":"2022-05-27T22:45:59.347","9":"2018-12-18T15:36:15.680","10":"2018-05-14T00:39:38.063","11":"2015-08-31T00:26:30.900","12":"2014-05-20T13:29:30.377","13":"2012-05-01T14:16:07.077","14":"2015-05-20T14:50:00.980","15":"2012-01-11T14:21:21.947","16":"2015-09-03T22:34:20.860","18":"2015-10-19T10:44:31.873","19":"2021-04-07T08:29:34.853","20":"2022-09-08T01:18:21.150","21":"2022-10-24T18:08:22.367","22":"2022-08-30T15:16:39.560","23":"2020-04-17T20:55:23.853","24":"2022-06-09T23:38:47.057","25":"2022-06-24T15:58:47.947","26":"2012-04-04T15:28:55.680","28":"2012-02-07T15:12:53.123","29":"2018-09-14T12:55:19.843"},"job_title":{"0":"Full
