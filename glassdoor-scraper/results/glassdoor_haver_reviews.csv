Few Pros and a lot of cons,"Good place to start right out of School to gain some work experience
Nice co-workers ready to help when you need it
Some exposure to some key economic/finance indicators based on the team you belong to
good health insurance
Company refunds for 1 class per semester (any tri state uni) if you get b or more","Not a place for someone who values career growth and skillset mobility.

Good place to build skills,"Relatively laid back work environment.  You can set your own schedule and take time off pretty much whenever you need time off.  Two weeks of fairly basic training.  Learning curve after that, but not too difficult to get over that hump.  Can't say anything about other DBMs, but the one I worked with was fairly hands-off and that ended up working well.",Can get boring and monotonous at times.  Little room for growth and development if your background does not align well with economics.  Upper management seems to be cracking down on little things that are insignificant to productivity.

Great Company to learn about Economics,"-Everyone is super friendly and helpful- some of the best people work or worked here!
-you learn a lot about Economics.  If a question is not clearly answered by the data or program, coworkers and the research team will gladly explain it to you
-interaction with top clients in the economics field
-entrepreneurial spirit pervades everything.  Everyone pitches in, can offer an opinion, and get heard.  Very little bureaucracy. 
-everyone on the same page or similar page with what should be done with the data, formulas, and program.  Everyone working with the data has an econ background and everything was specifically made to store and use economic data.  It makes development easy.","- location- especially for late shifts or early meetings

It's a job,"Work from home (for now)
Great diversity. Multicultural, multilingual, large age spectrum, women leaders.
Excellent benefits
Nice people
(maybe a con) If you're an RA: you can be terrible at the software aspect of this job for a really long time and never actually get fired; we'll literally just hand you baby work every day and pay you a little bit more every 6 months.","Old school software and management style
High turnover on certain shifts: workload can fall on you when someone leaves
office politics: being likable gets you just as far as being good at your work

Convenient and satisfying (albeit tedious) part-time work,"The learning curve to be decent/good at what you're doing typically lasts between 2-3 months. Beyond that, you have an idea of what type of projects you'll mainly be working on, which provides security and some comfort going forward. It's a relatively casual work environment and the people who work there are, on a whole, very pleasant. For students, it's very convenient work, considering proximity to subways and general requirements to work between 20-30 hours. I really liked my supervisor.","Almost all feedback that you receive will pertain to making a mistake. While there's definitely some perk to seeing your work reflect directly onto the database, you learn to settle for not hearing complaints from management as affirmation as good work.

Good for those beginning their career,"Good opportunity to learn Excel skills (Macro, Pivot Table, Vlookup, Functions etc.), how to gather large data sets and process them. Casual atmosphere. People here are willing to help (if you ask for)",Lag of employees' empowerment. You kind of have to wait for senior managers to help you or you figure out how to do the job on your own but you can't really make a decision on the process. Friendly and easy environment. Casual and can be too casual.

Very bad working environment but good for the resume,Because a lot of other companies use the Haver database it is good to have on your resume.,Horrible pay for the amount of work you do.

Structural Issues,"Great people within the teams, a very relaxed working environment, and a central Manhattan location.","Management needs a total shake down. The leadership from the top down is trying to play both sides for a CEO who inexplicably wants things to not change in a data company in the 21st century. For example if a complaint is raised about the unnecessary morning meetings and potential changes that can be made to it, that line of thinking is immediately shut down.",2019-03-15T07:43:49.927,Database Manager,2,5,1,1,2,0,3,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,3.3,2.6,3.2,3.8
Low Pay and no respect,"CEO is wonderful and really cares about data. 
Company did not lay anyone off during the pandemic
Good healthcare plan
Work life balance is good","Upper management loves to micro manage
�Fire drills� get created out of thin air
Employees are severely underpaid compared to what they should be making
Lots of promises made very few kept from upper management
No good opportunities for career advancement
Upper management makes everyone come to the office because they want to breath down everyone�s neck

Not a great place to work,"A decent part-time opportunity for recent graduates and those who want to split time between work and graduate school.

You can pick your hours, working between 20-40 hours per week on your designated shift.

A really easy job to do when you are working remotely.","Seniority does not matter. I worked under a database manager for 2 years. About a year and a half in he announced he was leaving, I applied for his position and did not even receive a second interview.

Very monotonous work. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are looking for enjoyment in your job, this isn't the type of work to do. 

You are judged based on the mistakes you made. If you are responsible for Client Problem Reports and receive average performance reviews, you will not be looked upon as a valued employee.

The hours, they stink. On the Asian and Euro shifts, you must adjust your life pretty dramatically to accommodate for these working hours.

No room for growth. Even if you do get a DBM job, you will probably be stuck in that position for a while, and you can't advance within the company.",2021-09-01T16:02:11.527,Economic Research Assistant,2,3,1,2,3,5,1,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,3.3,2.6,3.2,3.8
Not a decent job in NYC. Terrible Pay and Long Hours.,"Can work remotely. Don't need to commute every day in this pandemic.
Good experience to start off career. Somewhat a recognizable name in the industry. Not a big name though.
Coworkers are nice and chill here.
Good Insurance.","Terrible pay: Salary and bonus here are ridiculously low. Salary for new DBM , ADBM and tech person is less than 60K, pre tax! Some are even around 50K. Research assistants are only paid $15 per hour or the minimum wage. All these people should get a salary raise. I don't think people can live an average life in NYC with 40K-50K after tax. It is not surprising at all that the turnover rate is high in this company. It is funny that you can get $900 unemployment benefit per week from gov if you lose your job in NYC, but less than $900 per week after tax if working for Haver.

Long Hours: 9 hours every day with a 1 hour break. Day shift even works longer. There is Asian shift from 4 pm to 1 am and a European shift working from 1 am to 10 am! Working nights could be killing health and normal social life. But night shifts only get quite a little compensation for that. Sometimes people have to work on weekends with low compensation.",2021-02-05T21:12:19.877,Database Manager,1,1,1,3,2,5,3,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,3.3,2.6,3.2,3.8
