But a lot of red tape","11":"Lies Lies Lies","12":"Overall, the best Company ever worked for!!","13":"Great start to an Insurance career!","14":"Fun place to work!","15":"It's a grind","16":"good place to work","17":"Great Company and culture","18":"Great Place To Work!","19":"Good company","20":"Good money if you work hard.","21":"A Great Place To Work","22":"People take pride in their work","23":"Not as good as they make it sound","24":"Salary","25":"Nope","26":"Very high volume sales role","27":"A sales driven company with some cool in-house tech","28":"Great place to work ","29":"Great opportunity"},"pros":{"1":"Great management staff and employees.","2":"I recently worked at a company after becoming licensed to sell Health and Life Insurance. Initially, the company was supportive in helping me secure carrier agreements and appointments with various insurance companies. The benefits package and starting pay were satisfactory, and I appreciated the remote work setting and high-quality equipment provided.\n\nThe training program was enjoyable, with enthusiastic trainers and participants, which was truly inspiring. However, upon starting the actual work, I encountered several disheartening issues.","3":"Spring has one of the best onboarding programs I have been through for new hires in terms of preparing it's professionals for the actual job. Expectations are generally clear and while the work can be repetitive, it's generally life changing for the people I work with. I can also afford to choose my clients and truly help individuals, rather than pushing for sales in a disingenuous manner.","4":"Good benefits, 401 and HSA if you use it","5":"good environment and nice managers","6":"Where do I even start? This place is like a dream come true. The culture, work-life balance, freedom, leadership, and sales positions are all amazing. You truly get out what you put into the company the sales opportunity is endless. I had come from a couple other sales positions and SVG has the best training, resources, software, systems, and comp plan I have ever been apart of. Even if you have no sales experience, this place will train you for 5 or 6 weeks! Not only is it strictly training in the beginning, but you will be coached for 2-3 months after you start making dials. SVG truly wants to see you succeed and will be with you every step of the way. The culture here is next to none. Everyone that works here is positive and there is so much different ages, ethnicities, races, and backgrounds it's really amazing. The managers are managers for a reason, nobody is promoted for subpar performance which really drives you to succeed. I love it here and will be here for quite a long time!!!","7":"If you\ufffdre good at the job you get paid pretty well\nGood parties and employee benefits","8":"Management was pretty great, Training was good","9":"The starting pay is good and the training is very good. Definitely makes you feel like you\ufffdre going to be doing a different job at first. Being remote is a plus.","10":"Can be a fun job","11":"The downtown building is nice.","12":"Everything! from caring, to understanding you as a person, encouraging you every day, positive attitude and real talk from management that resulted in team leads and team mates to focus on doing a great job! Always enjoyed the Monday meetings with Management and Team, Quarterly meetings were met with enthusiasm and gratitude from CEO and VP (Amazing experience) knowing that corporate was in tuned with employee performance by providing feedback as well...what an honor! Became team lead and was able to perform in Sales better than when I started. Being transparent indeed, because people who are serious of working and dedicating themselves in this particular field will prosper, you just have to go after it!!","13":"- Pay scale is great during training! \n- You have an extensive training process.\n- After passing your local insurance license exam the company will help you gain other licenses in different states!\n- Commission is competitive!\n- Very team oriented\n- All leads are sourced by the company.\n- The job is remote.","14":"The remote option is nice and training was a ton of fun! The people at the office are super nice and everyone is very supportive! Great benefits and starting pay.","15":"Good commission and very nice office space\/can work from home","16":"good management with helpful team","17":"Learned a lot while working here. I got to be a expert at underwriting Medicare supplement insurance","18":"Great leadership - They make sure to set you up for success when you hit the phones.\nThe pay is great.\nHealthy competition\nThe culture is important - all the reasons I have left other companies or wouldn't go back are all the reasons I would stay here forever.\nAn opportunity to make what as much as you want!","19":"Remote work is available and decent pay","20":"You can make really good money if you put this work in to earn it.","21":"Excellent business - Helps their producers get licensed and appointed to sell insurance products across many states and with many different companies. Very extensive training and continued education. I had a great sales manager that was always willing to workshop what was working and what was not. Daily call expectations and KPI's aren't outrageous. If you're willing to work, there's money to be made and a great company culture for you.","22":"People genuinely care about doing good work and helping each other out","23":"Work from home and great flexibility","24":"Remote setting! Commissions and they give out rewards for Amazon, etc frequently","25":"Good pay, but insurance is very costly.","26":"Very common to have agents within first year achieve 6-figure income. They are very honest and realistic with their target income that was presented during training. Very good training provided and many resources for agents to succeed.","27":"Genuinely cool software, and cool people. Get the week between Christmas and New Years off (paid).","28":"Great management staff and employees.","29":"Great culture and amazing management"},"cons":{"1":"Long hours during AEP but manageable","2":"The work environment was unprofessional, with managers and staff not meeting expected standards. The practice of cold calling elderly individuals seemed to violate AHIP guidelines and raised ethical concerns. The company profited from employees' efforts but placed blame on them when sales were not made. The leads provided were largely ineffective, as they consisted of individuals who had merely inquired about Medicare at some point.\n\nThere was a noticeable lack of diversity and an uncompassionate management style. The commission structure was below average, and the work-life balance was poor due to constant outbound dialing. Viable leads were often distributed preferentially, creating an unfair work environment.\n\nDuring my visits to the office, I observed a 'bro culture' that limited opportunities for those outside this dynamic. The management played favorites, and the expectations set were unreasonable. The company's culture, which outwardly promoted being good people, was contradicted by the behavior of the higher-ups, who seemed disconnected and privileged.","3":"Spring does not like to take responsibility for the inbound leads that come into the system, or the variety of misleading advertisements that may bring someone into the system. That can lead to frustrating conversations which management will only insist you do your best with, rather than doing structural change.","4":"The Company has gone astray the last few years they have lost sight on why they have customers. The employees deserve to be heard an hourly increase which was overlooked on repeated requests. Half the yearly bonus as last year and most important of all the micro management from upper management they need to be on the phones and do it for 2 months. If you don't have sales under your belt you need to do it and see why our Company is successful and the money made needs to be towards employees or tenured agents will continue to leave. Put us in your stats because you are losing on that. Employees keep asking don't back down!","5":"not the best pay. low base and changed commission structure that is no longer the best","6":"NO CONS. Pay is great, benefits are great, hours are great, freedom to work from home or in office is great! I've never seen a company send their employees full office equipment monitors, keyboard, mouse, headset, camera, docking station, computer all to have an (option) of working from home.","7":"Work life balance \nLong hours","8":"Low pay and expectations of what the job entails and what it really is different. You are calling people constantly trying to get them to change insurance, which is how you make commission. They have quotas to meet, which are unattainable during the off-season. Sometimes clients do not have needs and you can not meet quotas.","9":"Leads are entirely cherry picked for certain reps. \nQuota can be ridiculous to achieve \nYou\ufffdre selling Medicare insurance to people who may or may not even need it.\nPay is not good.","10":"AEP overworking and low pay","11":"Lies, Leadership, Unethical, Outbound, Misserable","12":"Nothing at all from my part, this company demonstrated the most professionalism, caring and understanding while I was employed. Thank you so much SVG, you are an amazing company.!","13":"- Very fast pace environment and if you struggle with computer literacy\/technology you will find it very hard to advance. \n- Outside of training your base pay is very average.\n- Missing Quota can come with consequences.\n- A number of your leads will not be very cooperative outside of general enrollment period.\n- The job is remote.","14":"It can be a little hard to do some of the things in training if you have anxiety. Also you have to work 54 hours during AEP which is during the holidays.","15":"Long hours during the busy season (AEP)","16":"insane calls during busy season","17":"Needs to hit sales quota every month if not they will find a way to fire you. They want you to be very pushy when selling. There is a lead pool where people who do well with sales will get good leads and people who haven't sold much get stuck with horrible and cheap leads they buy from other places. They will tell you all the leads are requested by the client but some people have no idea what this company is and why we are calling them.","18":"Nothing so far! I love everyone here and the culture in the company. They truly care about their employees and it shows through everything they do.","19":"Business people cause stress for the tech people","20":"Sometimes it felt like management cared more about how much you were on the phone than the quality of the calls.","21":"The pay structure is a little wack - They start agents at $30\/hour throughout training, then progressively scales down to the mid to low teens\/hour. If you aren't a top producer or putting up crazy numbers, you aren't making money. Even if you do manage to hit your quota of base MS policies, if you aren't attaching Dental, Vision, and Hearing or Heart Attack\/Stroke policies, your pay is capped. Sourcing of leads is a mixed bag - sometimes the client was excited to take your call and get help with signing up for Medicare, sometimes you're the 15th agent to reach out to them from fifteen different companies.","22":"Communication breakdowns, it\ufffds a massive company. There are a lot of people who need to be informed but messaging gets disrupted despite best intentions.","23":"Commission structure is horrible for the amount of sales you make the income doesn't match unless you are a person who is doing 150% of goal or more every month.","24":"Can be a vicious cycle of calling especially when talking to seniors who aren\ufffdt in a great mood at the time","25":"Do you want an employer that considers you mental health with life vs personal balance? Not happening here, run!","26":"This is a high volume sales job and can be repetitive. This is nothing wrong with the company, just the nature of the job. Can become monotonous and experience burn out easily.","27":"The work culture is 100% sales driven in all parts of the business, even if that doesn't make sense. Poor planning, short development lifecycles, and yearly crunch time around the big sales periods.","28":"Long hours during AEP but manageable","29":"Draining work that is repetitive"},"review_date":{"1":"2024-11-02T05:48:22.567","2":"2025-01-30T10:23:48.017","3":"2025-01-05T21:41:58.593","4":"2024-12-01T14:48:38.670","5":"2025-02-06T15:35:36.380","6":"2024-10-05T14:45:23.483","7":"2025-02-04T06:57:46.700","8":"2025-01-16T11:18:17.503","9":"2025-01-05T20:21:35.943","10":"2024-10-18T09:15:51.037","11":"2024-11-17T10:39:22.420","12":"2023-10-09T08:23:18.660","13":"2024-04-29T16:38:31.587","14":"2024-08-09T09:26:58.687","15":"2024-10-06T18:57:03.253","16":"2024-10-08T14:00:29.693","17":"2024-05-28T11:15:25.870","18":"2024-07-25T06:02:43.803","19":"2024-09-25T17:54:29.387","20":"2025-01-19T21:10:41.963","21":"2024-10-17T12:56:17.303","22":"2025-01-10T03:23:34.913","23":"2024-12-30T05:50:51.520","24":"2024-12-05T09:44:25.237","25":"2024-12-21T14:44:26.533","26":"2024-10-10T10:22:19.130","27":"2024-10-03T17:54:00.967","28":"2024-11-02T05:48:22.567","29":"2024-10-30T19:11:04.050"},"job_title":{"1":"Sales Manager","2":"Inside Sales Associate","3":"Inside Sales Representative","4":"Retention Specialist","5":"Inside Sales Representative","6":"Inside Sales Agent","7":"Inside Sales","8":"Customer Success Agent","9":"Inside Sales","10":"Licensed Insurance Agent","11":"Inside Sales Agent","12":"Insurance Sales Representative","13":"Insurance Sales Agent","14":"Licensed Sales Agent","15":"Sales Advisor -
