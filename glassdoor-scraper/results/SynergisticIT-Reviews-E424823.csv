trying again and gain till I succeeded,"They never stopped working with me. Made me work on a wide range of tech skills which I did not think I needed to know. I Joined them after thinking after a long time as they were expensive. 

My mistake -I joined another place which was cheaper and paid them $10,000 and wasted 5 months of time and after that the bootcamp which had promised me a lot could not get me a single interview. You know I am talking about you Dojo.

At Synergisticit the Projects, the tech experience I received was very important to help me transition into a data scientist position.

I stayed with them for almost 9 months and had 33 screenings and 11 interviews. The Job market was tough, and I had my friends who were from my school who could not even get a single interview however me being with synergisticit made a lot of difference
I got experience as a data scientist, a data analyst, a BI analyst and somewhat as a ML engineer. 

after 9 months 10 days I am working as a Jr data scientist at a company with great benefits and hopefully good growth and a salary of $105,000","Investment and duration may not be for everyone.

bad  contract,the training is better than other companies,"training contract is strict . I had to pay them 18000 as settlement and 4000 in their lawyer charge and every month I am paying them 2000 dollars out of my paycheck. I had taken training and went on project and then left without finishing the 1 year contract which they had made me sign. they have same terms in training contract and in the other contract which they make you sign when you get project which is 25000 $ . if you join them and bypass them , take training and run away or join project and leave in middle of project . they send some emails  from their account and if you pay the penalties then it is fine if not their lawyer sends  notice, then court notice. I even had changed my phone and address somehow the lawyer still caught hold of me and sent letters to my new place and to my email and workplace. I hired a lawyer but he was charging 5000 for the case and said you will have to pay so I settled with them. I feel I should not have joined them or should have completed my contract as I am still paying through my nose for a small mistake. I cannot take manager name as glassdoor will not let me take his name he did not show me any mercy when I explained I don't have any money to pay for contract violation. good thing is I have a job presently to pay them otherwise I would be on road if it was left to them",2016-02-09T22:06:42.853,Programme Analyst,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL,4.1,4.1,4.1,4.3

Stepping stones to success,"Writing this review to give feedback as i owed synergisticit this .

good organization to get down and dirty on skills required by google, apple, visa ..... After being with synergisticit  i had 3 offers in 2.5 weeks and rather than clients choosing me i could turn tables on them and pick and choose clients rather than waiting by the phone and refreshing emails waiting to hear from them

i joined synergisticit almost 1.5 years back and during my time with them had opportunity to work on projects involving core java , advanced java , full stack technologies like angularjs, node.js and mongodb . Most of other firms which are bootcamps dont do 30% of what they do .

All in all after being with them and working on projects made me competent enough that i was able to move to secure a position at apple cupertino . I was with synergistic people for almost 6 months and it was a long process which was a stepping stone to my eventual success of getting an opportunity to work at apple.

You will work long and hard and get tired at times also . End result as earlier reviews say is great.  I give 2 thumbs up to them . listen to them and follow their process and you will get success. Dont rush stuff. After doing projects that's not enough you need to prepare yourself and they also give you tons of coding work which prepares you for other clients",sometimes technologies might be overwhelming and you feel or have self doubt whether you really know stuff.. when i interviewed at other clients i had 3 offers in 15 days so i guess i did know stuff,2018-12-18T15:36:15.680,Full Stack Developer,5,3,4,5,0,0,4,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.1,4.1,4.1,4.3
joke? scam? real deal?,"nothing fancy about this place but at least for me synergisticit was da best place for tech skills improvement /learning technologies related to java and full stack programming. 
friends and alumni of mine are still struggling to find good jobs and i had 2 offers withing 3 weeks of completion of my tenure with synergisticit. I have 30+ people who i know  who got free training , got paid training and some also paid for training and were either locked down for 2 years with the firm paying them low money and in some cases they learnt nothing and were once again had to struggle for finding a job.
opportunities after being with synergisticit and doing projects multiplied 10 x and i was not restricted in whioch organization i could join and had full freedom

hated doing my projects and understanding things at time --tough love as you might say --after everything done i look back at my time spent here as valuable.

received offers with google and Apple both long term gigs and am happy and satisfied as earlier not even startups looked at my profile.

i read some reviews where someone posted fake and fraud. to anyone considering synergisticit simple acid test is go into their office and ask them to show you people placed in the past 3-6 months . If they cannot show you anything then its fake which i can tell personally is not true and the entity or person posting these bad reviews is either a joke or a scam.

This coming from a person who has first hand experience. If anyone needs any answers ask me and work permitting i will answer them. I bring this up as i wanted to write a positive review and then saw these negative reviews and could not take it sitting down as an alumni.

All in all no other firm came close and this coming from a person who did not just want a job but something which made him recession proof",longer than anticipated took me 4 months as i had to take certifications for java 8 which took me 1.5 months.,2018-05-14T00:39:38.063,Full Stack Mean Stack Software Engineer,5,4,5,5,5,0,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.1,4.1,4.1,4.3
"There are better alternatives, like anything else","1.) You learn to listen or pretend to listen to the many lectures of management.

Most consulting companies are liars,"i joined them in 2012 after finishing my MS 
I had interviewed at 20 clients for full time jobs and was rejected even though i had a 3.7 GPA and with a MS in computer science.

 I joined a consulting company in New Jersey cant name it but starts with V and has software in name .gave notes set of questions and a resume and i started having interviews ..interviews which were taken by someone else. 

They told me to go to a small client and i worked there for 3 weeks  and was fired as i had no training which i was promised.

Joined another consulting co. in atlanta georgia same problem very poor training and nothing just notes and small orientation for 3 -5 days and some weekend classes . placed once more at another client and someone took interview for me and once again i was fired by client in 10 days.

I was very demotivated and planning to go back to India. i was recommended synergistic by my cousin who stays in bay area stating that she took training from them. on her recommendation i joined them and to my surprise their training was 1000 times better than any training which i took.
i cleared my own client interview and it took me 4 interviews to get a job and they took personal interest in me and my life and my future which was a welcome change. 

I felt confident when i joined the client . A client in LA rhymes with jamgem one of big healthcare clients i worked there for 3 years they did my h1b after 6 months i got an rfe and they had their attorney fight it and got it answered an my h1b was approved. I worked with them for 2 years on h1b and now i am at a entertainment giant in LA which employs ducks and mouse and has theme parks. 


I referred 5 of my friends to them all of them now working at fortune 200 clients .  i have had many people lie to them and cheat them i have never seen them do the same to anyone
Long story short i was foolish when i was young and got influenced by my classmates and other consulting companies and wasted 4 months of my life if i would have joined synergistic before i could have been on project earlier . I do thank my cousin and synergisticit people for making me what i am today. most consulting people lie to get you in sign a contract its only some who arestand by their word . I was given same course content by all only synergisticit actually taught me what was mentioned in course content practically

They are honest people and dont lie like other consulting companies. I know for a fact that there are so many consulting companies which provide training taking nothing but only synergisticit takes docs and deposits and even then people join them. if you are taken by them you are guaranteed a project i am proof of that.",training goes for almost 8-10 weeks at the same time i dont blame them as java is too extensive and we did projects which helped me clear interviews and survive on projects.,2015-09-03T22:34:20.860,Senior Java Programmer,5,4,4,5,5,0,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.1,4.1,4.1,4.3
Do not trust the fake reviews,None.Absolutely none. You will have  a better future finding a job on your own.,Most of the reviews (barring 4 or 5) have been written by the same person. They are all fake. The manager of this group is as despicable as  a person can be. He is so full of himself and thinks he is doing you a favor when in fact  all he is doing is exploiting you. The trainers are OK. But its not something you can't learn on your own if you don't put in a little bit of effort.,2018-04-01T15:45:59.100,,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,4.1,4.1,4.1,4.3
transparent as glass,"have worked with them for 3.6 years now and they have stood by me in thick and thin when i was almost out of status they helped me remain in status. they expect you to remain with them for 1 year after you get your h1b approval . i have know my own batch people who have used and manipulated them till date i have not seen them doing anything harmful to anyone. after people manipulating them they bought changes to their contracts . Training is good and marketing was excelent when i took training. They have best intentions for their employees .

i read lots of recent bad reviews and i doubt their authenticity and question the people writing the reviews if they ever had experience with any other consulting firm and if they are aware how other consulting companies operate. i read them being greedy and going for higher rates ...i highly doubt it as i know their priority is more towards longer projects and i have seen people being sent to longer projects even though when getting lower rates. my upbringing taught me to be thankful to people who help you and never forget them and for synergistic people did that.
i dont know if they write their own reviews but most of which is written in positive reviews is true and i can attest to it..whatever i read in negative reviews seems to be borne out of frustration, sarcasm and vengeance rather honest review and feedback..i wonder the psych of people writing those reviews and how successful they have been as they dont seem to be very people friendly and one thing i learnt during my experience is your interpersonal skills, being emphatic, friendly and having a good personality helps you more than your coding skills and believe me on that 

 i know other consulting firms stuffing 9 people in a 2 bedroom apartment, proxy interviews and printout of questions given in the form of training. reason i can say this is because i myself was subjected to such consulting firms before i joined synergisticit and at least they treat you like human beings. i being more experienced now know that they earned money from me in first year at the same time they spent a lot of money on me too. after first year they put me on percentage and i made more money than my colleagues in full time positions and i am putting this rview down as i intend to move on to a real big company which i always wanted to join which is headquartered in mounatin view and i want to say path was not easy but journey was enjoyable",contract which they have is strict and i came to know now they made more changes to enforce compliance if someone tries to leave before 1 year of getting placed or leaving after training. i came to know as someone who was in the batch after me contacted me as someone contact him about getting out of the contract and leaving in middle and had been sent court notice by their employment attorney and he had to travel from nj to california for court appearance and had to finally pay the contract violation and attorney fee which were like 30k which he was paying in installments otherwise his immigration situation would have been in trouble due to a civil and court proceedings showing up on his background check and his immigration documents. my advice is to just do a 1 year employment and then move on if you want to explore greener pastures to be on safe side as work is stressful and then court hearings are even worse. traing may be tough for electric or other backgrounds so join if you have coding background otherwise you will be in training for 4-5 months,2015-10-19T10:44:31.873,Java Developer,4,4,4,5,5,0,4,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.1,4.1,4.1,4.3

Very thorough in approach,"very thorough in their approach to what i learnt at Synergistic. Had hands on experience to tech which i would not have been able to get elsewhere.
value which i gained by being here was comparable to something which will take me 3-4 times longer to achieve elsewhere. I could leverage the experience at synergisticit to move onto a another client based on the projects done here. 
it may be intense at times for some people but the achievements after everything when the dust settles around you , the sweat and the grime pays off.  I had calls from revature, was considering hackreactor/Galvanize but these people had the best word of mouth from people i had spoken to. The best thing was that i could work remotely if i wanted to and could come onsite if i wanted to which helped a lot.
$95 Grand  was my offer after finishing with Synergisticit and that is wonderful for a guy who companies did not even consider emailing back before joining synergisticit guys.

organized chaos leads to a brighter career,"Good coverage of different technologies. i heard good things about them and experienced it myself. people previously who were unable to find jobs in startups after getting experience with synergisticit got offers from apple, paypal, intel .

good place for people with basic understanding of programming in java or any other language and people with experience. If you dont know any programming dont join as you will have a hard time as there is projects which you have to do etc and a solid foundation is needed in basic programming.

 if you have a good foundation are a good student i assure you they will make you succeed. I have seen average pay rates after working with them something in the range of 75k to as high as 130k i guess that also depends if you had previous experience how well you present yourself and stuff.

 They work with you and the manger is also supportive and would tell you things good for you but you might not like them. If you are rude you will be called out, dont come to office same. You can do projects remotely also as long as you do are regular and dont miss days.

I am pleased to say that i was able to get couple of offers within 3 week of finishing my projects with them and they putting me into the market. I after 5 months know almost 3 times more than my peers before i joined synergisticit what they told me that what you learn here in 5 months people take 4-5 years to learn is almost true to a certain extent. 

I am witness to one person who used to drive uber to supplement his income and after working with synergisticit he is working for paypal now and getting 100+k. To anyone thinking about coming over to them just have confidence work hard and stay positive and be regular and i promise you that very soon you will be working at a great client and will have multiple offers rather than just one. 
I am living proof for the above. Anyone needs any answers message me here and i will try to answer. It took me 4 months to write this review and it was long due and i guess i owed them this. 

Was giving 4 stars but decided for 5 stars as even though they are not structured the end result is what counts and that was me getting more stronger technically and me in being demand by multiple clients. I wish good luck to everyone.. god bless",there is no planned structure only in the end all the pieces come together. Duration is pretty long as much as 4-5 months but i feel the topics covered are so many that it makes sense that it takes that much time.
