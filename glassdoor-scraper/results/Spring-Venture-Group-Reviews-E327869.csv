Company that CARES!,Benefits are amazing and get better every year. Managers are supportive and understanding and care about growth. This company does work that makes a positive difference for thousands every year around the country. Environment is healthy with everyone working towards one common goal. Company is transparent from the top down when it comes to goals and performance.,"Expectations of employees are high so be prepared to work hard to achieve goals.

Good Training and it all starts out so very nice...,"I recently worked at a company after becoming licensed to sell Health and Life Insurance. Initially, the company was supportive in helping me secure carrier agreements and appointments with various insurance companies. The benefits package and starting pay were satisfactory, and I appreciated the remote work setting and high-quality equipment provided.

The training program was enjoyable, with enthusiastic trainers and participants, which was truly inspiring. However, upon starting the actual work, I encountered several disheartening issues.","The work environment was unprofessional, with managers and staff not meeting expected standards. The practice of cold calling elderly individuals seemed to violate AHIP guidelines and raised ethical concerns. The company profited from employees' efforts but placed blame on them when sales were not made. The leads provided were largely ineffective, as they consisted of individuals who had merely inquired about Medicare at some point.

There was a noticeable lack of diversity and an uncompassionate management style. The commission structure was below average, and the work-life balance was poor due to constant outbound dialing. Viable leads were often distributed preferentially, creating an unfair work environment.

During my visits to the office, I observed a 'bro culture' that limited opportunities for those outside this dynamic. The management played favorites, and the expectations set were unreasonable. The company's culture, which outwardly promoted being good people, was contradicted by the behavior of the higher-ups, who seemed disconnected and privileged.",2025-01-30T10:23:48.017,Inside Sales Associate,3,3,5,1,1,1,1,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,3.6,3.6,3.7,3.8
Great Pay for Hard Work,"Spring has one of the best onboarding programs I have been through for new hires in terms of preparing it's professionals for the actual job. Expectations are generally clear and while the work can be repetitive, it's generally life changing for the people I work with. I can also afford to choose my clients and truly help individuals, rather than pushing for sales in a disingenuous manner.","Spring does not like to take responsibility for the inbound leads that come into the system, or the variety of misleading advertisements that may bring someone into the system. That can lead to frustrating conversations which management will only insist you do your best with, rather than doing structural change.",2025-01-05T21:41:58.593,Inside Sales Representative,4,4,5,3,5,5,5,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,3.6,3.6,3.7,3.8
The Company focuses on retaining customers not employees,"Good benefits, 401 and HSA if you use it",The Company has gone astray the last few years they have lost sight on why they have customers. The employees deserve to be heard an hourly increase which was overlooked on repeated requests. Half the yearly bonus as last year and most important of all the micro management from upper management they need to be on the phones and do it for 2 months. If you don't have sales under your belt you need to do it and see why our Company is successful and the money made needs to be towards employees or tenured agents will continue to leave. Put us in your stats because you are losing on that. Employees keep asking don't back down!,2024-12-01T14:48:38.670,Retention Specialist,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,3.6,3.6,3.7,3.8

The BEST place to work!!!,"Where do I even start? This place is like a dream come true. The culture, work-life balance, freedom, leadership, and sales positions are all amazing. You truly get out what you put into the company the sales opportunity is endless. I had come from a couple other sales positions and SVG has the best training, resources, software, systems, and comp plan I have ever been apart of. Even if you have no sales experience, this place will train you for 5 or 6 weeks! Not only is it strictly training in the beginning, but you will be coached for 2-3 months after you start making dials. SVG truly wants to see you succeed and will be with you every step of the way. The culture here is next to none. Everyone that works here is positive and there is so much different ages, ethnicities, races, and backgrounds it's really amazing. The managers are managers for a reason, nobody is promoted for subpar performance which really drives you to succeed. I love it here and will be here for quite a long time!!!","NO CONS. Pay is great, benefits are great, hours are great, freedom to work from home or in office is great! I've never seen a company send their employees full office equipment monitors, keyboard, mouse, headset, camera, docking station, computer all to have an (option) of working from home.",2024-10-05T14:45:23.483,Inside Sales Agent,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,3.6,3.6,3.7,3.8

"Great Culture, low pay","Management was pretty great, Training was good","Low pay and expectations of what the job entails and what it really is different.

"Overall, the best Company ever worked for!!","Everything! from caring, to understanding you as a person, encouraging you every day, positive attitude and real talk from management that resulted in team leads and team mates to focus on doing a great job! Always enjoyed the Monday meetings with Management and Team, Quarterly meetings were met with enthusiasm and gratitude from CEO and VP (Amazing experience) knowing that corporate was in tuned with employee performance by providing feedback as well...what an honor! Became team lead and was able to perform in Sales better than when I started. Being transparent indeed, because people who are serious of working and dedicating themselves in this particular field will prosper, you just have to go after it!!","Nothing at all from my part, this company demonstrated the most professionalism, caring and understanding while I was employed.

Great start to an Insurance career!,"- Pay scale is great during training! 
- You have an extensive training process.
- After passing your local insurance license exam the company will help you gain other licenses in different states!

- Very team oriented
- All leads are sourced by the company.

- Outside of training your base pay is very average.
- Missing Quota can come with consequences.
- A number of your leads will not be very cooperative outside of general enrollment period.
- The job is remote.",2024-04-29T16:38:31.587,Insurance Sales Agent,4,3,5,4,4,5,3,,,3.6,3.6,3.7,3.8

Great Company and culture,Learned a lot while working here. I got to be a expert at underwriting Medicare supplement insurance,Needs to hit sales quota every month if not they will find a way to fire you. They want you to be very pushy when selling. There is a lead pool where people who do well with sales will get good leads and people who haven't sold much get stuck with horrible and cheap leads they buy from other places. They will tell you all the leads are requested by the client but some people have no idea what this company is and why we are calling them.,2024-05-28T11:15:25.870,United Medicare Advisor ,3,1,3,2,4,2,3,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,3.6,3.6,3.7,3.8

A Great Place To Work,"Excellent business - Helps their producers get licensed and appointed to sell insurance products across many states and with many different companies. Very extensive training and continued education. I had a great sales manager that was always willing to workshop what was working and what was not. Daily call expectations and KPI's aren't outrageous. If you're willing to work, there's money to be made and a great company culture for you.","The pay structure is a little wack - They start agents at $30/hour throughout training, then progressively scales down to the mid to low teens/hour. If you aren't a top producer or putting up crazy numbers, you aren't making money. Even if you do manage to hit your quota of base MS policies, if you aren't attaching Dental, Vision, and Hearing or Heart Attack/Stroke policies, your pay is capped. Sourcing of leads is a mixed bag - sometimes the client was excited to take your call and get help with signing up for Medicare, sometimes you're the 15th agent to reach out to them from fifteen different companies.",2024-10-17T12:56:17.303,Licensed Insurance Agent,5,3,3,3,5,5,4,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,3.6,3.6,3.7,3.8
