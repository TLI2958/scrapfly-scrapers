{"summary":{"0":"Solid company, brilliant team","2":"Challenging and purposeful work, with a word-class team","4":"Great WLB and People","5":"A Dynamic and Innovative Workplace","6":"Experienced leadership, big growth potential, very fast","7":"Fast moving startup with lots of talent","10":"Very happy still after 2 years!","11":"Don't recommend","12":"High Opportunity \/ High Autonomy","14":"Smart people taking on a big challenge","15":"Engineer","16":"Toxic Environment"},"pros":{"0":"Learning so much about data management, piplining, cloud computing and everyone is willing to collaborate on hard problems. Very generous and inclusive environment.","2":"I find the work equally challenging and rewarding. The problems we tackle are complex and require innovative solutions, which keeps me engaged and motivated.\n\nOur product also addresses a real market need, which adds a sense of purpose to daily tasks.\n\nThe culture minimizes unnecessary meetings, allowing ample time to focus on development and problem-solving without constant interruptions.\n\nFurther, the flexibility to work remotely is a significant attractor to me. I get to to be as head's down as I need in an environment that suits my needs, and really benefits the work-life balance.\n\nThe team is truly remarkable.","4":"Great people, super friendly and low ego, leadership is always interested in learning and growing, and work life balance is good though there is on-call which usually isn't too bad","5":"The company fosters a dynamic and innovative environment where creativity and collaboration are highly valued.\n\nPros:\n\nSupportive Culture: The team is highly supportive, and management is approachable and genuinely cares about employee growth and well-being.\nOpportunities for Growth: There are plenty of opportunities for professional development and career advancement. The company encourages continuous learning and provides resources for skill enhancement.\nExciting Projects: Working on cutting-edge projects that have a real impact in the tech industry is both challenging and rewarding.\nFlexible Work Environment: Puzzle.io offers a flexible work environment. Remote work options and flexible hours make it easy to manage personal and professional responsibilities.\nInnovative Mindset: The company is always looking ahead and encourages innovative thinking and problem-solving. This mindset keeps the work interesting and forward-thinking.","6":"Taking on mega-industry incumbents can be intimidating. They have more resources, more time at grade, and more room for error. Fortunately, the execs at Puzzle are experienced startup leaders who have raised a lot of capital and navigated the rollercoaster that is a startup many times - and it shows. With such growth at the company, there is tremendous opportunity to grab the reins and lead an initiative as long as you have good reasoning behind what you're doing. And if you want to move fast, it's pretty quick over here.","7":"Puzzle is a remote-first company - there is no expecting in-office time at all. There are 2 'off site' trips\/year that are mandatory, but they are held at fun locations (San Fran, Palm Springs, Jackson, WY, etc). \n\nTech stack is typescript (front and back end) + React, and a little Python. I'm really impressed with the talent of everyone at the company.","10":"Exciting and rewarding work.\nCompetent coworkers.\nGood management.","11":"It's a job and it pays.","12":"Puzzle is a truly rewarding product to work on. A fully automated accounting and finance suite for founders is long overdue. There are many tough and exciting engineering\/product challenges to solve here. It is very much a startup, and that means there is a lot to do, a lot of opportunity and autonomy. Everyone here has a lot of power to shape the product.\r\n\r\nThe team is talented and experienced and is generally pretty easy to work with. Puzzle truly embraces remote work but makes multiple opportunities per year available to meet your coworkers in person. The pay\/perks are strong.\r\n\r\nManagement has significant experience building products from the ground up. The founders are repeat founders and do their best to give the team time to build a robust product. They understand tradeoffs and treat all employees like owners. They value your input and are eager to work with you to build something great. They also know how to operate a company, ensure a healthy runway and sell a vision.","14":"- Getting to work on a very real problem for customers who need a solution\r\n- Iterating to improve our product every day\r\n- Collaborating with really smart folks who are committed to helping each other and the company succeed.\r\n- Great workspace &amp; perks: fancy laptops, home office budgets, on sites, off sites, travel budget, cool gear etc.","15":"-Some of the smartest people i've ever worked with \r\n-everyone aligned around solving a huge problem","16":"None. Horrible place to work."},"cons":{"0":"Complicated product for those without accounting backgrounds.","2":"Due to the rapid growth of the team, we have experienced several rounds of changes in internal processes. While I trust that these changes are necessary for scaling, they can sometimes be disruptive and are not yet fully optimized.\n\nThe workload can occasionally become overwhelming because there is so much to get done.\n\nOne notable thing is the CEO's tendency to use a blunt-tone when addressing the team. It can affect team morale (especially with newcomers who don't yet realize that it's mostly a communication-style used to emphasize urgency and import)","4":"The company is still in early stages and priorities can change quickly which can be frustrating","5":"As with any fast-growing company, there can be occasional growing pains. However, these are often addressed quickly, and feedback is always taken seriously.","6":"There's a lot to do at a growing company. With so much going on, it's not uncommon to feel like you could use an extra hand.","7":"Medical benefit premiums are expensive for a family (premiums are 100% free for employee), no 401k match, but otherwise solid benefits.","10":"Going through growing pain as company expands.\nThings can be a bit more organized.","11":"Toxic environment, overworked, unbalanced responsibilities, unkept promises, favoritism, lack of transparency and accountability.","12":"It is a startup, which means that process, projects, resources are not always well-defined, but its getting better every day.\r\n\r\nBuilding an accounting ledger is not easy.","14":"-It an early stage product, things go wrong and rarely choose to do so at convenient times - that said it is all part of the fun.","15":"-company is remote, so not a huge in office culture. Hoping that will change as the company expands","16":"People have an \"I'm better than you\" attitude. Very overworked."},"review_date":{"0":"2024-06-12T16:29:44.967","2":"2024-06-07T12:12:25.093","4":"2024-09-30T17:51:48.890","5":"2024-05-29T11:28:05.273","6":"2024-05-30T22:46:17.450","7":"2024-06-11T11:34:41.653","10":"2024-06-11T11:59:27.880","11":"2023-11-15T10:41:00.280","12":"2022-04-04T19:22:38.117","14":"2022-03-01T17:28:07.237","15":"2022-02-01T18:25:53.197","16":"2021-10-28T21:12:58.970"},"job_title":{"0":"Senior Software Engineer","2":"Senior Software Engineer","4":"Software Engineer","5":"GTM Manager","6":"Marketing","7":"Senior Software Engineer","10":"Staff Software Engineer","11":"Senior Software Engineer","12":"Software Engineer","14":"Product Manager","15":"Engineer","16":"Software Engineer"},"rating_overall":{"0":5,"2":5,"4":4,"5":5,"6":5,"7":5,"10":5,"11":1,"12":5,"14":5,"15":5,"16":1},"rating_work_life_balance":{"0":5,"2":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":4,"7":5,"10":5,"11":1,"12":5,"14":5,"15":4,"16":1},"rating_compensation_and_benefits":{"0":4,"2":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":5,"7":5,"10":4,"11":1,"12":5,"14":5,"15":5,"16":1},"rating_career_opportunities":{"0":5,"2":5,"4":4,"5":5,"6":5,"7":5,"10":4,"11":1,"12":5,"14":5,"15":4,"16":1},"rating_culture_and_values":{"0":5,"2":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":5,"7":5,"10":5,"11":1,"12":4,"14":5,"15":4,"16":1},"rating_diversity_and_inclusion":{"0":5,"2":5,"4":4,"5":5,"6":5,"7":5,"10":5,"11":1,"12":4,"14":5,"15":5,"16":1},"rating_senior_leadership":{"0":4,"2":4,"4":4,"5":5,"6":5,"7":5,"10":5,"11":1,"12":5,"14":5,"15":4,"16":1},"rating_recommend_to_friend":{"0":"POSITIVE","2":"POSITIVE","4":"POSITIVE","5":"POSITIVE","6":"POSITIVE","7":"POSITIVE","10":"POSITIVE","11":"NEGATIVE","12":"POSITIVE","14":"POSITIVE","15":"POSITIVE","16":null},"rating_business_outlook":{"0":"POSITIVE","2":"POSITIVE","4":"POSITIVE","5":"POSITIVE","6":"POSITIVE","7":"POSITIVE","10":"POSITIVE","11":"NEUTRAL","12":"POSITIVE","14":"POSITIVE","15":null,"16":null},"overall_rating":{"0":4.3,"2":4.3,"4":4.3,"5":4.3,"6":4.3,"7":4.3,"10":4.3,"11":4.3,"12":4.3,"14":4.3,"15":4.3,"16":4.3},"compensation_and_benefits_rating":{"0":4.2,"2":4.2,"4":4.2,"5":4.2,"6":4.2,"7":4.2,"10":4.2,"11":4.2,"12":4.2,"14":4.2,"15":4.2,"16":4.2},"culture_and_values_rating":{"0":4.2,"2":4.2,"4":4.2,"5":4.2,"6":4.2,"7":4.2,"10":4.2,"11":4.2,"12":4.2,"14":4.2,"15":4.2,"16":4.2},"diversity_and_inclusion_rating":{"0":4.1,"2":4.1,"4":4.1,"5":4.1,"6":4.1,"7":4.1,"10":4.1,"11":4.1,"12":4.1,"14":4.1,"15":4.1,"16":4.1}}
