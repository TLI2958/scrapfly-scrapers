"Solid company, brilliant team","Learning so much about data management, piplining, cloud computing and everyone is willing to collaborate on hard problems. Very generous and inclusive environment.",Complicated product for those without accounting backgrounds.,2024-06-12T16:29:44.967,Senior Software Engineer,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
Worst Startup Ive ever been apart of,The market is ready for an AI accounting solution and it is exciting to be apart of that,"This is an extremely toxic and political organization run from the top down. Just look up the founder and LeandUp... you will come across many lawsuits. 

No one wants you to succeed unless it is because of them or if they can take credit. I was constantly told not to do too much and to stay in my lane. Then when I could accomplish anything, all credit would be taken away from higher-ups.

I was fired with no warning after exceeding goals I was told were unrealistic.",2024-12-21T15:28:03.373,,2,3,3,2,1,3,1,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
"Challenging and purposeful work, with a word-class team","I find the work equally challenging and rewarding. The problems we tackle are complex and require innovative solutions, which keeps me engaged and motivated.

Our product also addresses a real market need, which adds a sense of purpose to daily tasks.

The culture minimizes unnecessary meetings, allowing ample time to focus on development and problem-solving without constant interruptions.

Further, the flexibility to work remotely is a significant attractor to me. I get to to be as head's down as I need in an environment that suits my needs, and really benefits the work-life balance.

The team is truly remarkable.","Due to the rapid growth of the team, we have experienced several rounds of changes in internal processes. While I trust that these changes are necessary for scaling, they can sometimes be disruptive and are not yet fully optimized.

The workload can occasionally become overwhelming because there is so much to get done.

One notable thing is the CEO's tendency to use a blunt-tone when addressing the team. It can affect team morale (especially with newcomers who don't yet realize that it's mostly a communication-style used to emphasize urgency and import)",2024-06-07T12:12:25.093,Senior Software Engineer,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
Huge opportunity for growth/ strong leadership at the helm.,"Really exciting opportunity to be a part of something greenfield and groundbreaking. The market is ripe for disruption and Puzzle could definitely be the one to take down some of the decades old incumbents in the accounting space. 

Really really smart folks. I'm truly blown away any time I ""sit in a room"" with my colleagues. I feel like its helping me grow both professionally and personally.

Winning team mentality. None of that ""we are a family"" nonsense which is always a red flag to me when I hear it. We all like each other, we push each other to be better, and we all want to win. 

Fully remote, great perks/benefits, meaningful equity that actually makes you feel a sense of ownership.",Not really a con if you know what you are getting into but this is an early stage startup. If you are looking for someone to tell you what to do and how to do it- this isn't the place. If you are a self-starter who wants autonomy and impact- Puzzle is for you.,2024-04-26T14:01:50.920,,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
Great WLB and People,"Great people, super friendly and low ego, leadership is always interested in learning and growing, and work life balance is good though there is on-call which usually isn't too bad",The company is still in early stages and priorities can change quickly which can be frustrating,2024-09-30T17:51:48.890,Software Engineer,4,5,4,4,5,4,4,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1

"Experienced leadership, big growth potential, very fast","Taking on mega-industry incumbents can be intimidating. They have more resources, more time at grade, and more room for error. Fortunately, the execs at Puzzle are experienced startup leaders who have raised a lot of capital and navigated the rollercoaster that is a startup many times - and it shows. With such growth at the company, there is tremendous opportunity to grab the reins and lead an initiative as long as you have good reasoning behind what you're doing. And if you want to move fast, it's pretty quick over here.","There's a lot to do at a growing company. With so much going on, it's not uncommon to feel like you could use an extra hand.",2024-05-30T22:46:17.450,Marketing,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
Fast moving startup with lots of talent,"Puzzle is a remote-first company - there is no expecting in-office time at all. There are 2 'off site' trips/year that are mandatory, but they are held at fun locations (San Fran, Palm Springs, Jackson, WY, etc). 

Tech stack is typescript (front and back end) + React, and a little Python. I'm really impressed with the talent of everyone at the company.","Medical benefit premiums are expensive for a family (premiums are 100% free for employee), no 401k match, but otherwise solid benefits.",2024-06-11T11:34:41.653,Senior Software Engineer,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
Fast-Paced and Passionate Company,The entire team is hungry for success. If you are looking to be a part of a largely ambitious startup then this is the place for you!,"We want to win and there's a lot of work to do!

- Some of the smartest, most talented people I have worked with.

High Opportunity / High Autonomy,"Puzzle is a truly rewarding product to work on. A fully automated accounting and finance suite for founders is long overdue. There are many tough and exciting engineering/product challenges to solve here. It is very much a startup, and that means there is a lot to do, a lot of opportunity and autonomy. Everyone here has a lot of power to shape the product.

The team is talented and experienced and is generally pretty easy to work with. Puzzle truly embraces remote work but makes multiple opportunities per year available to meet your coworkers in person. The pay/perks are strong.

Management has significant experience building products from the ground up. The founders are repeat founders and do their best to give the team time to build a robust product. They understand tradeoffs and treat all employees like owners. They value your input and are eager to work with you to build something great. They also know how to operate a company, ensure a healthy runway and sell a vision.","It is a startup, which means that process, projects, resources are not always well-defined, but its getting better every day.

Building an accounting ledger is not easy.",2022-04-04T19:22:38.117,Software Engineer,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
Tackling hard problems with engaged colleagues; it's fun and challenging,"Puzzle has been a great professional experience so far for me. Iï¿½m motivated to get up and start work each morning to build something great. Puzzle is a small company but is very serious about professional development and company values such as helping teammates. The whole team is high caliber, capable and experienced. The team is also very transparent; Puzzle shares its finances, roadmap, goals, and board meeting takeaways with the whole company.

The benefits are good for a company of our size and remote culture is promoted and embraced. I have full workdays, but always have time to take care of myself and my family outside of work and do take vacations/time off. I really enjoyed our latest offsite in January 2022 where we all came together (both in person and virtually given covid) to plan for 2022. We uncovered some key insights through our discussions that we are planning to incorporate in our roadmap.

One of the best parts about Puzzle is the problem we are tackling. Iï¿½m pretty familiar with the space and feel that the market is huge and we are executing on our plan to take advantage of the opportunity. Puzzleï¿½s leadership team is experienced and we are off to a great start and backed by well-known investors. I highly recommend Puzzle if you are a person that likes to work on challenging technical problems with support from colleagues and thrive in a startup environment.","Not really a con, but I would recommend Puzzle to self-motivated individuals with initiative, and not so much to people that are used to being told what to do each day.",2022-01-25T11:52:43.523,,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
Smart people taking on a big challenge,"- Getting to work on a very real problem for customers who need a solution
- Iterating to improve our product every day
- Collaborating with really smart folks who are committed to helping each other and the company succeed.
- Great workspace &amp; perks: fancy laptops, home office budgets, on sites, off sites, travel budget, cool gear etc.","-It an early stage product, things go wrong and rarely choose to do so at convenient times - that said it is all part of the fun.",2022-03-01T17:28:07.237,Product Manager,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,4.3,4.2,4.2,4.1
