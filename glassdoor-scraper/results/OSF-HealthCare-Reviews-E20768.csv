"Resources &amp; staffing good, culture was terrible","Alaris pumps &amp; epic for charting is a preference of mine, �short staffing� was the charge nurse having a team which is better than most places
- free college while employed","Without being raised as a new graduate at this facility the staff nurses treat newcomers like they don�t know anything. There is a rigid adherence to how the nursing body has always done things as opposed to best practice or the companies own current policies. Leadership prefers testaments of long running staff members to discern their best moves. Human Resources for employee relations is not an asset, they strongly side with leadership and are generally unreachable. This network leads to cliques running the unit, as they can report and expect responses to planned cohesive statements whether their singling out of a staff member is warranted, truthful, or not.
