This company makes good decisions and avoids financial crises and layoffs. Cautious approach pays off in long run. Good work-life balance - you take your work home, your time is your time.","6":"While i wont be able to assess the entire company, based on my experiences in Risk. My tenure at the bank has been a positive one. The benefits of working in an employer of this size is that you are valued for your inputs on new projects and visions for the bank. Projects are rewarding as you feel your inputs are valued as an employee. There are controls but is not extensive to the point where work is difficult to complete. Pay structure is competitive with the overall market. Whether it is someone just joining or others that are more tenured in their profession, C1B remains a great place to work. Again, this is based on my time at RISK. Work life balance is great. benefits are competitive. 401k match is competitive. Great People!","8":"- Good working culture \n- salary as per industry standard\n- Good perks \n- Employee engagement and training resources \n- growth opportunities","9":"Good to newbies getting into corporate work out of college\/transitioning","11":"The team I am working is super, I like the people. The manager is very understanding as well.","12":"Really nice campus. Strong business in all economic environments - don't have to worry about layoffs in recessions\/COVID\/2007-2009 crash, etc. A true meritocracy. If you work hard and deliver you will be rewarded. If you do just enough to get by, you will not. If you have an unhealthy sense of entitlement, you'll put this criteria in the cons section, but it's a pro for me.","13":"Good work life balance\nChallenging problems","14":"From a software engineer's perspective this is an excellent place to 'validate' your career and get started fresh out of college or if you're newly transitioning in to the field.\n\nOther notable qualities include:\n- Very clean office space located immediately off of the freeway\n\n- Most people you'll run in to are friendly and collaborative\n\n- Health, Medical, 401k, etc.\n\n- Personal development scenarios such as taking classes or getting certifications are compensated\n\n- Managers are aware the company pays below industry standards so they've made their interview processes much easier for technical roles.","15":"there is nothing to do there","16":"I work with some amazing people and truly enjoy the work I do every day. It is challenging, but interesting and I enjoy solving the problems we face.","18":"Good to learn about finance and early careers","19":"Good place to work and have more experience","21":"Good name recognition on resume.

There is breakfast\/snacks free for the employees every single morning. The benefits are amazing and available almost immediately after you start. The bosses that I have are amazing. \n\nThis is the one and only job that I have ever loved so much and enjoy going to work everyday. I see my colleagues smiling and always happy and have never really seen an unhappy co-worker. \n\n#1 place for me to work.","28":"Great place to work for","29":"Free snacks, holidays (some not all) are paid and off work","30":"Stable job with ok base pay and pretty good benefits. If you are moderately capable, you'll have a job here forever. That's worth a lot.","31":"good benefits\ncompetitive salary\npushed me to develop my skills","32":"Depending on the team you land on the work life balance is really good. Pay is not too bad although it could be better. Going through some technological revamping that should bring the companies way of doing things a bit more up to date.","33":"- community opportunities\n- hockey game suite\n- work was manageable","34":"There are zero reasons to work at Credit One Bank unless you are absolutely desperate for a job.","35":"Some amazing people work there.","36":"Less volatile, stable company and","37":"Great pay and bonus structure, great benefits, and employee environment.","38":"Pretty easy work and secure position.

Credit One has developed and achieved a way of retaining top talent, promoting positive working environments, and investing in its employees.","42":"1. Great company to kickstart your career.\n2. Gives opportunities to people from all kind of career background.\n3. Not much work pressure and easily manageable. \n4. 3 weeks of vacation holidays and 2 weeks of Sick leave.","43":"Free snacks Company events Dress code is business casual","44":"There are no pros at this place.","45":"Amazing atmosphere and team culture.","46":"-Diverse workplace\n-Surrounded by many knowledgeable, fun people","47":"The company culture is great and I really enjoy working with team. I think there is a lot of potential to network since most everyone knows\/is familiar with each other. Amazing work life balance","48":"Nice office, has cafeteria with drinks and snacks in the morning. Everyone is really nice, and willing to help.","49":"Management is willing to help at any given moment. You will always have guidance."},"cons":{"0":"Learning Opportunities and Certification benefits .","1":"training isn't very helpful for all","4":"Not hybrid work. Not the most innovative place - strategies are stable and slow to develop. Because of company stability, advancement can sometimes be up to turnover, which is currently low.","6":"Promotion needs to be collectively agreed upon by multiple leaders. Leaders would influence tremendously as far as which teams are allocated resources. Others have expressed issues with WFH. Maternity and Paternity Leave of absence is less than other banks.","8":"- Little bit old technologies \n- job opportunity limited to Vegas and Dallas.","9":"Lots of remote workers, not enough qa, not enough collaboration","11":"The salary increases and position growth is hard to obtain.","12":"No corporation is perfect, and Credit One has it's issues like all other workplaces, but I believe the good outweighs the bad. Historically siloed org structure where interdepartmental collaboration was poor. Luckily this is getting substantially better in recent years with executive regime changes and retirements. I question the decision to get rid of the cafeteria and think the company should consider bringing it back. I'd prefer if cable news was banned from TVs in the building, the workplace should be void of left &amp; right wing propoganda.","13":"Less competition \nFood is not served in cafeteria","14":"Some of which include:\n- No remote capabilities, you'll drive in to the office and join a teams call for 9\/10 of your meetings.\n\n- Your performance is irrelevant and there's little to no incentive to work hard. Your best chance at earning a promotion is by negotiating an offer letter from a new company or going to a new company after 6-12 months.\n\n- From a software engineering standpoint the work will feel challenging, but not rewarding. The company utilizes older versions of enterprise software that will give you very little transferable knowledge. You will need to block out time for yourself and build upon your own personal development if you want individual growth.\n\n- Severe lack of faith in senior management is widespread especially within technical positions.\n\n- Company pays far below the standard for many of their positions, and in doing so the talent pool is smaller and turnover is much higher.\n\n- Minimal flexibility in your role and in most cases you will be taking an endless stream of tickets\n\n- Cross-team collaboration is laughably poor.","15":"you don't learn anything new","16":"My job could be 100% remote, but we do not have that option. Additionally, I am underpaid relative to the amount of work I do and expertise I provide.","18":"In-person office. No remote or hybrid work culture.","19":"No work from home job","21":"Low career advancement. \nToxic managers who think of employees as tools to get work done for their own KPIs.","22":"The salaries, and bonuses in the lower levels should be higher","23":"A lot of high talent","24":"Not a lot of holidays, data issues constantly, broken toilets\/urinals often, weird in office vibes, treat contractors and temp workers poorly, and no working from home.","25":"- low bonuses for non executives\/upper management (the executive car section is nice though. Aston Martins, Porsches, lambo urus, retro cars, etc) -no work from home or hybrid -turnover is high so you\ufffdll have to explain the same things over and over.","26":"Abusive management, fear culture, discriminatory firing practices, lack of willingness to hire from within, toxic environment with senior management implementing old school business professional standards.","27":"The only con I have is the 5 minute walk to my car. Huge parking lot and can\ufffdt park in the reserved parking spots. I look at it as getting my steps in daily. Other than that I have no other cons.","28":"everything is great so far","29":"Low pay for the expectations, you are expected to stay longer than expected to \ufffdcomplete\ufffd work, lots of mindless meetings that serve no purpose, \ufffdprovide\ufffd for your advancement however they won\ufffdt compensate you a fair market value unless you come from the outside, employees are not treated fairly for the same role","30":"It's a boring, single product-line bank (credit cards). Never going to be anything splashy or spectacular, never going to be an exciting place to work or on the forefront of industry innovation.\n\nManagerial incompetence is largely tolerated, as to avoid difficult conversations, especially at senior levels.\n\nMediocre performers get the same pay as top performers. Leadership is concerned with not paying anyone too much, other than the CEO, rather than paying top performers for what they bring to the table. The company has fantastic financial performance every year, but doesn't share that equitably with employees.\n\nToo few holidays, no hybrid flexibility (full-time in office).\n\nNone of the above will change anytime soon.","31":"some ppl a ruthless and cutthroat","32":"They start some people at lower levels than they should start and some at higher levels than they should start so it is a bit of a crap shoot getting into the right starting position. Having a lot of education and data skills certainly helps.","33":"- corporate environment\n- not remote or hybrid friendly","34":"Terrible leadership (stand down) that engages in mental gymnastics to explain away horrendous employee satisfaction scores (stand down). How do I know this? Nearly 30 people either quit or moved to other departments since the beginning of 2022 to avoid working with the leaders overseeing our department. \n\nThe bank engages in predatory practices that take advantage of an already disadvantaged group of people looking for credit. \n\nMy advice? Stand down and run...run as far away from this place as you possibly can. Leadership makes too much money to care about their employees well-being or happiness while they work in the prison they call an office building.","35":"Depending on your LOB, there can be silos and challenges with communication.","36":"Not flexible and salary not good","37":"Don't really have any it was a great place full of great people..","38":"Technology is outdated and many managers have little knowledge of modern methods or technologies.","39":"- Management is very traditional and rigid.\n- Lack of innovation","40":"Extremely siloed work, lack of adequate training that leads to months of self-teaching to begin being productive","41":"More Holidays and\/or increase the number of vacation days an employee receives.","42":"1. Leaderships do not encourage to explore cutting edge technology, mostly because financial industry is highly regulated.\n2. No work from home option.\n3. Salary is lesser than other financial banks.\n4. Vacation hours and sick leave needs to be accrued. \n5.  Other than the paid leaves, there is very limited holidays given to the employees. Most of the federal holidays are not celebrated. No holiday in the Dec other than 25th Dec and 1st Jan. Thanksgiving holiday is just one day. For god's sake please give 2 days for Thanksgiving.","43":"Culture Support from Leadership Training","44":"low pay to work in a soul crushing office with inconsiderate people that will annoy you and get you and your family sick. There is virtually no investment in official training courses outside of a udemy account. GL. Low pay and they expect you to continue working at home to learn on your own. No work life balance. Just work because you are a sub human cog in the corporate machine. Tens of billions of dollars in profit aren't enough for this bank. 99% uptime isn't enough for this bank. Unfathomable corporate greed and unrealistic expectations is all you will see here. Forget about any remote work opportunities as well. They want to control every facet of your life.","45":"Mostly self trained. Not tons of good on the job training.","46":"-Some managers are very condescending and disrespectful\n-Lacking in initial training","47":"Compared to employment competitors, compensation\/benefits generally aren't as competitive until reaching senior positions","48":"A lot of the file's they have are like 10+yrs old, and no hybrid or remote work allowed at least for our department.","49":"I
