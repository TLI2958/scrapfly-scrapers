I used to dread going to work in my past companies on Monday morning. At Figma, I find the projects and team mates interesting and want to go and work in the morning. Figma is also fully remote, which gives me more time to spend with family compared to being at the road in the Bay Area traffic. Coming from FANG companies, I found work place politics to be close to zero. Very high percentage of people try to do what is right for Figma, which is very refreshing.","7":"Great company with a bright future ahead. The product is in a league of it's own, the people are smart, and the culture is great.","8":"Teams are always working to keep employees informed of upcoming changes and to maintain a positive company culture. Catered breakfast and lunch Monday - Thursday. Variety of snacks and beverages available all week long. Lots of good effort from the BEI team to create a culture of belonging.","9":"Company is very well positioned, coworkers are very strong and humble","10":"great perks, cool product, industry disruptor - lots of smart people on PDE. Dylan Field is a genuine person.","11":"Great pay\nGood manager\nGood learning opportunities + growth","12":"Great Perks. Good Pay. Vacation.","13":"People care about the product, you make something that matters.","15":"Dylan is a fantastic person as are many of the leaders at Figma. The BDR segment is growing quickly and offers a clear pathway for promotion to AE role. Plenty of talented people to learn from and fun product","17":"amazing work place it is","18":"decent salary and good work-life benefit","20":"The best company to work for. Great perks and culture, and phenomenal leadership.","21":"Great teammates and culture\n\nSolid WLB","22":"Remote work, great coworkers, travel for offsites","23":"Great place to work, awesome people","24":"The only positive I can think of is that the product is very well loved by customers.","25":"Great place to work. Recommend","26":"Great product, smart people, good culture","27":"An amazing company to work with","29":"Doing some of the best work of my career here. The company has a conspicuous lack of ego and everyone is just really good at what they do and extremely kind. Lots of opportunity to build new things, be heavily involved in product decisions, and solve hard technical problems (all at once).","30":"Great culture and community at all of the hubs","31":"Perks, people are amazing and overall great","32":"- This is by far the best product I've ever sold. The pure joy and excitement heard from customers truly inspires me to want to put my best foot forward. I strive to have the customer experience match the product experience. \n- People here care about their job and the people around them. From a sales Org, that can be rare in my experience. \n-Leadership cares, they know when things are tough and they honestly try and get to the root cause and figure out a solution. But as the company gets bigger this some times takes longer. \n- This job is more than just a quota, It's about wanting to better yourself and leadership constantly harps on wanting Figma to be a place we look back on and lean on all our learnings and experiences.","33":"Leadership suite is very approachable. Great perks with lots of travel. Everyone is super nice and the culture is fun.","34":"Bright coworkers who you can learn from, selling a top-tier product that customers adore","37":"- people are passionate about their work\n- employees are valued and treated with respect (by each other and by higher-ups)\n- benefits are good and lots of fun perks\n- remote culture","38":"Very good company - great people - smart and kind, product is a beast.","39":"you grow a lot while here","40":"Amazing product customers love\nWorld class leadership\nCollaborative, values driven culture","41":"It was fun good place.","42":"Great company to work for, competitive pay","43":"great product, people and work life balance","45":"Great Product\nGreat customers to work with","46":"This is the best company I've ever worked for. Leadership is super supportive. They have a great mentorship\/career progression program and are very clear on what expectations are to be promoted within a certain amount of time.","47":"- worklife balance is good","48":"They provide a ramp period of 6 months for new hires. They pay for home office setup and have great wellness benefits. But it's all to distract you from the really challenging work environment and low performance of their upstream segments.","49":"Figma is a great place to work!"},"cons":{"0":"None that I can think of","2":"Marketing leadership losing vision \nCMO feels weak no strong leadership \nHard to get promoted, elusive favoritism based criteria","3":"- Tough to hit quotas\n- Lots of changes","4":"Not much. Decent experience to work","5":"The company benefits and perks come at a price. The grind is real and is celebrated by execs. Be prepared to put in long hours, especially as major events like Config approach. Burnout is a common occurrence due to the intense workload. It's challenging to maintain a work-life balance and truly disconnect, as the company's ambitious nature demands constant focus on launching new features, updates, and hosting events at a rapid pace. These relentless working conditions are unsustainable in the long run. Compounding the issue, opportunities for career growth and upward mobility are limited, leaving employees feeling stagnant and facing a career plateau. You need to be extra proactive in advocating for yourself or else you'll just be swept away in the grind.","6":"No major complaints at all. When we see growing pains, leadership is generally quick to address them. Even though company is fully remote, if you want face time with others, the Hubs are not very close. For instance, in Bay Area, I have to commute to SF to see team mates. Luckily I do it only once or twice a month, which works fine. Would love to see more Hubs in the East Bay.","7":"Management struggles to make decisions and to maintain focus on important initiatives. Compensation is below average considering the businesses performance and there is no clear career trajectory for most employees.","8":"Teams can be very distributed across the globe. Other teams have been able to connect through regular offsites, but with my small, international team, the opportunities to fully connect and meet my team members in London and Tokyo has been very limited.","9":"Career advancement can be challenging","10":"The expectations are not realistic. Globally hitting targets (or coming close to them) but that is because of 10-12 people out of 100 reps are hitting target across all segments. Most people not even hitting 70%. More focus on \"activity\" than what is actually working. Managers want to look good to their managers who want to look good to the CRO....everyone is afraid to say what is actually going on. Toxic, stressful work environment. Burnout rampant. Books are not quality accounts, inflexible about changing processes to include methods that would actually help us increase revenue.","11":"Nothing much to say here","12":"Lot of hours working. But worth it.","13":"High performance culture, not bad comparatively, but definitely not a place to coast. Could be a pro tbh.","15":"Typical growing pains, be adaptable to change","17":"salary could be higher but its ok","18":"limited opportunity in career development","20":"None to note at this time.","21":"Great product but need to make radical improvements\/updates in order to continue to scale growth at a similar rate","22":"Internal Processes, too many slack channels due to most employees coming from slack","23":"Not great pay, can be hectic depending on the team","24":"The company I signed up for is not the one that I joined and I don\ufffdt recommend sellers join at this time. Figma is struggling to shift from natural PLG to enterprise sales, and that struggle highlights the sales team leadership\ufffds immaturity. Expectations are constantly changing, impossible PIPs have been issued, and a reorg has occurred - all issues making it challenging to succeed.","25":"Constant changes. Senior leadership might not have best interest on IC","26":"Terrible comp structure, horrible billing model","27":"CEO sold us out to Adobe","29":"Company is growing really fast which comes with some tensions that any growing company has, but still coping with it some of the best I\ufffdve seen","30":"Faced paced work, but manageable","31":"Eng leadership and overall is pretty clueless and over prioritized partnerships over innovation","32":"- Sure, quota can be tough at time. I won't lie, but show me a sales role where quota isn't a constant pain point. We're in sales and we live and die by quota. \n- Leadership has taken a lot of time to better evaluate how territories\/books are cut. They have very recently adjusted our quota to not only be Net New ARR but also renewal ARR. This is a recent, and very welcomed shift, that rewards us for fighting customer churn, which previously wasn't the case.","33":"Work has become a grind and burnout is common. Not a good ratio of senior to junior employees. Grew too fast and unsustainably.","34":"Clearly overhired for a product whose pricing\/packaging\/use cases don't align with the need for a massive commercial sales team. Accounts aren't high quality, and most of them are already (happily) using Figma self-service plans. Avg deal size is crazy small and all they care about is how much pipeline you're generating, even if it's fake.. would not suggest joining sales here anytime soon.","37":"- there can be a lot of pressure at times, due to the popularity of the company (but of course, this can be true at many places)","38":"I don't think I have a con right now.","39":"no cons right now at all","40":"Limited growth opportunities from IC to people management in Sales","41":"Managers cared too much about how well you worked.","42":"Not very clear upward mobility","43":"Frequent changes in role responsibility and priorities, can be tiring and confusing","45":"Too many changes too quickly. \nHad 5 different managers in 2 years. \nLeadership changes the direction all the time and is not too patient to give people the time to adapt.","46":"I have no cons to list.","47":"- Not much to say","48":"I hope I can say that the sales organization lacks a lot of experience and it shows. Upper management does not have a viable solution to improving the performance of their upstream market segments. They tried shifting courses 3 times in my short tenure.","49":"No cons that I can think of"},"review_date":{"0":"2024-12-18T13:01:48","2":"2025-02-11T23:14:44.767","3":"2025-01-24T15:25:33.363","4":"2025-01-26T21:10:20.397","5":"2024-05-08T09:47:52.500","6":"2024-06-06T07:03:18.213","7":"2024-11-06T10:45:08.540","8":"2024-09-24T07:20:14.737","9":"2024-11-26T21:14:59.263","10":"2022-11-09T13:43:45.470","11":"2023-12-19T02:56:21.783","12":"2023-12-28T13:57:44.417","13":"2023-11-13T15:28:10.400","15":"2023-08-11T08:33:31.767","17":"2023-10-12T00:59:05.560","18":"2023-10-11T20:56:04.020","20":"2024-03-24T17:30:38.150","21":"2024-02-22T13:57:20.313","22":"2024-02-08T18:22:20.007","23":"2024-02-23T19:54:27.230","24":"2023-08-22T08:34:43.630","25":"2024-01-24T12:04:23.840","26":"2024-01-03T07:31:15.863","27":"2024-01-23T23:34:02.853","29":"2023-09-23T09:22:00.963","30":"2024-08-16T18:19:39.640","31":"2024-08-01T13:28:18.180","32":"2024-02-09T09:20:00.303","33":"2024-05-23T19:40:29.970","34":"2024-01-30T08:54:32.003","37":"2024-03-05T11:37:24.433","38":"2024-04-26T12:47:43.243","39":"2024-05-05T15:15:58.450","40":"2024-11-19T14:28:03.613","41":"2024-11-17T17:43:56.120","42":"2024-11-17T16:01:50.510","43":"2024-10-17T13:50:10.670","45":"2024-09-03T12:07:19.550","46":"2024-08-22T16:38:42.320","47":"2024-09-23T08:52:22.883","48":"2024-07-09T11:32:14.810","49":"2024-08-28T09:57:42.397"},"job_title":{"0":"Account
