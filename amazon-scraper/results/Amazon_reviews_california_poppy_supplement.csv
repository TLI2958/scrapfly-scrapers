The other day I was cooking up a storm and had been in the kitchen for hours, my feet and back were hurting. I took a couple of these babies and before I knew it the foot pain was gone, I felt good enough to go for an hour and a half drive and visit with my daughter (she was up late settling into her own place). Mind you I didn't get back home till 2 o'clock in the morning and I felt pretty good pain wise. That was my first time taking this supplement, now I usually take 2 or 3 at a time- once or twice a day- depending on how bad I feel, I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep.

Must have at all times...,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2018",True,"I first heard of California Poppy for pain in 2012 when a segment on Dr. Oz discussed this item.  But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.  They are NOT like a drugs related to poppy flowers (heroin).  They have not shown up during urine drug testing at work.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51td8W-MaiL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CBOTRuCxL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zU0HtPuHL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gYMoPfjJL._AC_.jpg

May be a dose issue?",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023",False,"I tried this for as-needed calming (rather than taking daily). First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I’m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems.

I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KIbPz5ZJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tiyTvNPmL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OTX-E2AfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t+QesskGL._AC_.jpg

Normally, I’d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different—a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I’d heard these were supposed to be nature’s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn’t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity—who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I’m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I’d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn’t feel groggy or out of it—just calm, focused, and oddly energized.

With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.

I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain.

California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called “glutamate” which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don’t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you’re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I’ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ErE1fXrhL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aN0fnenFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ta4W-IuKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AnYHzeOSL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+QNhdArQL._AC_.jpg

(Note - This Is Not For Pain)",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015",True,"I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OtQndo79L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/316CMENJCPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BtWrlD+sL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xEFBKeZML._AC_.jpg

The type of sleep also varies, as sleep comes at several different levels. Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste.

Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FLWNq2vUL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bNmU4CB5L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mglMM3cvL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Zi+yKEzWS._AC_.jpg

This, however, is a close second!HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a bottle which is glass, not plastic.  I am partial to those.CAPSULESThese are pressed pills with a dividing line down the center if you want to cut them in half.  They break easily.CONTENTSI love what is in these, but did want to point out that sometimes certain herbs will register positive on drug tests.  I know of some people who ate poppy seed cookies or cakes that had false positives, so check on that prior to using these if that is a concern to you.  Otherwise the ingredients in this are pretty nice.SMELL/FLAVORThis has lavender in it.  I do occasionally burp up lavender after taking with a meal.  I love it so it does not bother me.  It might bother some people.DIGESTIONI had no issues with digestion other than occasional burps with lavender usually only once and that is it.DO THEY WORK?I must say these do seem to work well to not only help me sleep , but help me go back to sleep even after having to go to the bathroom at night.GROGGY?I don't feel groggy when I wake up, but I do feel rested.THE BOTTOM LINEI like these a lot.

Unfortunately this product missed the mark. First red flag was the proprietary blend. For those who do not know, manufacturers use ""proprietary blends"" as a way of preventing someone else from reformulating their product by showing the ingredients but hiding the amounts of each. This is bad news in the supplement world for a couple of reasons: 1) you don't know how much of each ingredient you are getting, so there is no telling if you are getting a very underdosed or overdosed amount of any particular ingredient, and 2) because you do not know how much you are getting of each ingredient, you don't know if you are getting ripped off or not. This product is quite expensive at $36 before tax. You can deduce that the combined total of all these ingredients in the proprietary blend are less than half thanks to the disclosure of 48-53% alcohol which leads me to the next red flag.To help with this perspective, this product is ""96-106 proof."" Sure, the serving size is quite low, but alcohol is known to be neurotoxic and deleterious to sleep. Definitely not something I want to see in a sleep/relaxation product. But at least you might be able to take comfort in that this won't likely be abused for its alcohol content as the taste is unbearable.I really can get past things that are not the best taste if it means I am getting something of great benefit to my health.

He has always worked the late shift since he was 15 and recently got an early morning job, so his body isn't adjusting too well. Figuring that it was either the hops or the GABA in the beer that was making him drowsy, I tried making him some herbal tea blends with hops since I had some on-hand. It didn't do anything. So of course, to Amazon!I wasn't searching for a topical product but it aligned with his mentality that pills are bad, so I took a chance on it. Wowow this product W O R K S. Not just for my husband, but for me! I don't have trouble falling asleep, but I don't get good, deep sleep once I'm in that state. This cream fixes that issue completely! I feel so incredibly rested - provided I give myself time for 8 hours.I was sold on one reciew that mentioned they don't even remember falling asleep, and I must say that is exactly my experience as well! I started with 1 pump on my wrists and enjoyed the results, but the best rest comes from applying it to my temples! And I don't need very much when I apply it there compared to my wrists, so it's cost-saving too!If you are unsure on this one, I say take a chance.

I didn't believe that a cream could help you destress and relax or even help you get back to sleep. I was almost afraid to try it just in case it was true! So I did the safest thing possible, I used half the dosage before bedtime. As I sat in bed reading for a few minutes as I always do I was overcome by a feeling of ""end of the day"" relief. I never finished reading that page. In the morning, I found my book on the floor. I never have sleep problems but that night I had barely been in bed a few minutes before my lights went out and that was on half a dose. At the next opportunity I got brave and used a half dose in the middle of the day. It felt like i had a midday pause for a cup of tea! It did not make me sleepy but I did feel renewed and less stressed to continue the rest of the day.  From that point I experimented with dosing depending on how stressed I was feeling.I like the idea of a topical cream. I can keep it in my purse and not worry it's going to spill like liquid drops. HealthyGut products are non GMO, they have no fillers and they use a cGMP facility. However, I don't see information about 3rd party lab testing. In my opinion that is probably the most important certification. you can have. Lastly, unfortunately these supplements from Healthy Gut are very overpriced especially lacking some important certifications.

But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.

Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I’m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems. It may help if you’re too wound up to sleep.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KIbPz5ZJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tiyTvNPmL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OTX-E2AfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t+QesskGL._AC_.jpg

I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KIbPz5ZJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tiyTvNPmL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OTX-E2AfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t+QesskGL._AC_.jpg

Normally, I’d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different—a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I’d heard these were supposed to be nature’s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn’t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity—who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I’m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I’d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn’t feel groggy or out of it—just calm, focused, and oddly energized.

I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier.

As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal.

I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain.

California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called “glutamate” which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don’t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you’re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I’ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ErE1fXrhL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aN0fnenFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ta4W-IuKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AnYHzeOSL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+QNhdArQL._AC_.jpg

(Note - This Is Not For Pain)",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015",True,"I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OtQndo79L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/316CMENJCPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BtWrlD+sL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xEFBKeZML._AC_.jpg

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night.

Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste.

Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FLWNq2vUL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bNmU4CB5L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mglMM3cvL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Zi+yKEzWS._AC_.jpg

This, however, is a close second!HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a bottle which is glass, not plastic.  I am partial to those.CAPSULESThese are pressed pills with a dividing line down the center if you want to cut them in half.  They break easily.CONTENTSI love what is in these, but did want to point out that sometimes certain herbs will register positive on drug tests.  I know of some people who ate poppy seed cookies or cakes that had false positives, so check on that prior to using these if that is a concern to you.  Otherwise the ingredients in this are pretty nice.SMELL/FLAVORThis has lavender in it.  I do occasionally burp up lavender after taking with a meal.  I love it so it does not bother me.

It comes in a small 2 fl oz bottle with a dropper, which is nice for measuring doses. This stuff packs a punch! The dose is only 1 teaspoon, but it has a strong taste. I definitely recommend having a glass of water on hand to chase it down. Hit The Hay does seem to work. It helps me unwind and relax before bed, and on nights I use it, I fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. It definitely takes the edge off and helps me quiet my mind.

Unfortunately this product missed the mark. First red flag was the proprietary blend. For those who do not know, manufacturers use ""proprietary blends"" as a way of preventing someone else from reformulating their product by showing the ingredients but hiding the amounts of each. This is bad news in the supplement world for a couple of reasons: 1) you don't know how much of each ingredient you are getting, so there is no telling if you are getting a very underdosed or overdosed amount of any particular ingredient, and 2) because you do not know how much you are getting of each ingredient, you don't know if you are getting ripped off or not. This product is quite expensive at $36 before tax. You can deduce that the combined total of all these ingredients in the proprietary blend are less than half thanks to the disclosure of 48-53% alcohol which leads me to the next red flag.To help with this perspective, this product is ""96-106 proof."" Sure, the serving size is quite low, but alcohol is known to be neurotoxic and deleterious to sleep. Definitely not something I want to see in a sleep/relaxation product. But at least you might be able to take comfort in that this won't likely be abused for its alcohol content as the taste is unbearable.I really can get past things that are not the best taste if it means I am getting something of great benefit to my health. However, you almost cannot use this product after you try it for the first time because of how of putting the taste is.I wish I had one thing good to say, but they made it really hard.

He has always worked the late shift since he was 15 and recently got an early morning job, so his body isn't adjusting too well. Figuring that it was either the hops or the GABA in the beer that was making him drowsy, I tried making him some herbal tea blends with hops since I had some on-hand. It didn't do anything. So of course, to Amazon!I wasn't searching for a topical product but it aligned with his mentality that pills are bad, so I took a chance on it. Wowow this product W O R K S. Not just for my husband, but for me! I don't have trouble falling asleep, but I don't get good, deep sleep once I'm in that state. This cream fixes that issue completely! I feel so incredibly rested - provided I give myself time for 8 hours.I was sold on one reciew that mentioned they don't even remember falling asleep, and I must say that is exactly my experience as well! I started with 1 pump on my wrists and enjoyed the results, but the best rest comes from applying it to my temples! And I don't need very much when I apply it there compared to my wrists, so it's cost-saving too!If you are unsure on this one, I say take a chance.

I didn't believe that a cream could help you destress and relax or even help you get back to sleep. I was almost afraid to try it just in case it was true! So I did the safest thing possible, I used half the dosage before bedtime. As I sat in bed reading for a few minutes as I always do I was overcome by a feeling of ""end of the day"" relief. I never finished reading that page. In the morning, I found my book on the floor. I never have sleep problems but that night I had barely been in bed a few minutes before my lights went out and that was on half a dose. At the next opportunity I got brave and used a half dose in the middle of the day. It felt like i had a midday pause for a cup of tea! It did not make me sleepy but I did feel renewed and less stressed to continue the rest of the day.  From that point I experimented with dosing depending on how stressed I was feeling.I like the idea of a topical cream. I can keep it in my purse and not worry it's going to spill like liquid drops. HealthyGut products are non GMO, they have no fillers and they use a cGMP facility. However, I don't see information about 3rd party lab testing. In my opinion that is probably the most important certification. you can have. Lastly, unfortunately these supplements from Healthy Gut are very overpriced especially lacking some important certifications.  That really limits the customer base who will no doubt go elsewhere until they find an answer as the founders did in their 'story'.

I am giving it three stars for that. I was having a stressed out moment this morning from family where I literally felt like that Scream face painting, and I decided to try a pump's worth on my inner arm. The cream is an opaque brown color like a coffee with creamer. It is not oily and seems to absorb quickly without irritation, though stings very, very slightly (I am guessing from alcohol content in it and I have baby sensitive skin; on regular skin it is probably not noticeable). I appreciate there is no added fragrance or perfumes. I did experience palpitations about 15 minutes after I put it on, and I never usually get those. It may be that I should have used less than a full pump as I am a petite woman at 125 lbs.

It’s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it’s hard for me to get a “full” dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there’s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don’t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally — the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don’t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I’d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I’ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it’s such a strange combination of flavors I’m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.

The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description.

It has a bold, flavorful taste and is made with high-quality organic ingredients such as poppy from California, blue vervain, tart cherry, elderberry, and hawthorn. It has a bold flavor that is described as sweet and fruity, with a mild cinnamon undertone. The supplement comes in a 4.07oz bottle and has 100 servings.Overall, the Apothekary Wine Down is a natural supplement that can help individuals unwind and prepare for a restful night's sleep. Its unique blend of herbal extracts and lack of common allergens make it an attractive option for those looking for a safe and effective way to relax and improve sleep quality.I have to admit that when I first heard about Apothekary Wine Down, I was a bit skeptical about its claims of being ""wine replacement"" and promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality. I've tried other supplements in the past that promised similar benefits, but ultimately fell short of delivering on their promises. However, after giving Wine Down a try for several nights in a row, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. I like the flavor and easy-to-take formula made it a breeze to incorporate into my bedtime routine, and I found myself feeling more relaxed and calm than usual. I noticed that I was sleeping better and waking up feeling more refreshed, which was a great bonus. While I still approach supplements with a healthy dose of skepticism, I have to say that Apothekary Wine Down has won me over - it's definitely a product that I would recommend to others looking for a natural way to unwind and improve their sleep. My only ""complaint"" is a steep price. But if you break it down per dose, it's definitely cheaper than wine :)",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31esPkojpzL._AC_.jpg

And this tincture, when it touches my tongue, spreads a wonderful taste over it- and a quick moment later, there is a slow burn that begins and remains for a bit after.Wine Down comes in a lovely dark white colored glass bottle (not see through, white glass) with a dropper attached to the cap. Both the bottle and dropper are glass and both, the very best quality. The directions tell you to squeeze one drop on or under the tongue and let sit for ten seconds. If you don't like the taste however, you can put it in a drink. You are told in these directions you can take this tincture up to four times a day.When I took Wine Down, I felt the effects quickly- within a couple minutes, and in all honesty, it does have a very good calming effect. It worked so well I took to taking it with me during the day and taking it when I needed to relax. I wouldn't  say Wine Down is terribly intense though, it's just something that actually helped me to relax- as if before I couldn't quote catch my breath and after- well, there was no longer that problem.Wine Down is something that I will definitely be using in the future, because, for me, there were so many positive effects- not only did the tincture relax me but when I took it before bed, it also helped to get me to sleep better- during my “wind down” time (and now this is my “Wine Down” time ;).I am really in love with this product, I don't go anywhere without it (just in case I need it) and have never been so happy to have chosen this product to review on Amazon as- it would have never been something that I tried on my own!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31esPkojpzL._AC_.jpg

The date on the bottle says 10/19, so I'm pretty sure they're not expired. I've been taking them like I normally would, but it's just...odd, because I know they're not supposed to look like this (unless they've changed?). I will still order these, I'm just confused. Hopefully I won't get sick or anything, I have 34 capsules left and I take two every morning.UPDATE: 6/12/17So I ordered another bottle a few days ago and received the bottle, to which on the box it stated that it was a new and improved formula. The capsules looked exactly like the ones that inspired me to write this review, they looked like the capsules in the picture. So the company finally got around to making it official that they changed the formula, on the box. I can't say for sure if this new formula works better than the old one, as I was sure that they were onto something with the liquid inside the capsule. Oh well. I ordered the elderberry syrup as well (not the nighttime one) and I take that sometimes when I need the extra help and want the benefits of having the liquid. So I guess just be aware that there's the change to the formula. Too bad they couldn't have just made another version of this capsule and kept this one with liquid inside.

 Elderberries have been traditionally used for functions of the gastrointestinal tract, supporting a healthy body temperature and perspiration during an acute immune challenge, and for supporting the resilience of the body throughout the difficult winter months. Both elderflower and elderberry are rich in polyphenols, which have antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress is often produced during an immune response, and having sufficient antioxidant storage in the body may help to maintain the health and integrity of tissues.

Since Gaia Herbs was just a seedling in 1987, we have focused on connecting people, plants, and the planet to create healing. We use only organic methods to cultivate more than 6.5 million plants each year. That same organic approach continues throughout our manufacturing.

A long story short, I have been struggling with menopause, I’m sure a lot of other people are having a really hard time with it like I was, but none of my friends had it that bad. I was having a hot flash every 20 min. All day long. When I wasn’t having a hot flash, I was sweating even when it was cold out! I also was going through major depression, even though I never struggled with depression before! I lost my job because I was so depressed I didn’t get out of bed, I was so sweaty and miserable.. this is terrible to say, but there were days where I thought it would be easier to die! I never ever knew menopause could be so horrible. I looked up stuff everyday that might give me some relief.. I’m not sure if we can mention other products, but I got Menoease, which helped a lot with the hot flashes.. it took about 3 weeks to notice a difference. While looking things up everyday, I read that Schisandra can help with your mood, fatigue and hot flashes.. So I ordered my first bottle and took some as soon as it came.. within 3 days, I felt like a brand new person.. I’m not sure if it’s also helping with the hot flashes since I’m still taking Menoease.. but it is 100 percent helping with the depression and fatigue. I get out of bed every morning now, my mood is Good and I have energy!!! I’m on my second bottle of this Schisandra and I will make sure I never run out! I know every product doesn’t effect everyone the same! But, if you are depressed and always tired.. I would honestly give it a try! I noticed a little difference in just one day.. but in about 3 days I noticed a huge difference! I put two half droppers full in about 2 oz of orange juice every morning!! Hope this helps, no one should have to struggle with menopause or depression!!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31r76GsmdiL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L12wqRuCL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f1WrVR4JL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gwUJFEI8L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614EB0NBCKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KKQOdrnPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51RIWJOjGTL._AC_.jpg

I am very happy to switch back to the other brand i was using, which was prescribed by my acupuncturist.I do not like to give bad reviews and while i think this is a good product there is something in this that i just cannot tolerate, perhaps it's because it's missing the 'intrinsic factor' which i found to be lacking in, which helps my gut/body assimilate the b-vitamins.If you don't have a sensitive stomach and generally don't have a problem tolerating B vitamins go for it, but if you do try looking for a B vitamin that has intrinsic factor in it. Ofcourse do your research, it might help you as it has helped me.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aU-Cb8gFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41A1OzR7rlL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51H233h8I4L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31R-Qu3ZgYL._AC_.jpg

Every year starting in August until the first hard freeze my symptoms are horrible here in Northeast Wisconsin. Itchy & watery eyes, itchy throat & roof of my mouth, sneezing constantly, stuffed up and running nose, congestion.I never had allergies as a kid, but in my late teens to early 20’s I started getting them really bad. I took all of the over the counter meds, Zyrtec, Claritin, you name it. Those products worked, but had side effects. The OTC meds dried out my mouth and sinuses so bad. I would get nosebleeds, be super drowsy or tired. And I have read other bad things about anti-histamines that they can cause dementia after taking them over many years.My father-in-law is a big believer in natural products so he recommended Allerplex to me in combination with Fermented Cod Liver Oil by Blue Ice.I am a skeptical person and thought there was no way something like this could work. I was so wrong. I have read many reviews of this product and some are correct when they say it takes some time to start working. I believe it has to build up in your system to start making a difference. So don’t take two pills and say it doesn’t work. The dosage I read works best is 6-12 daily.I started my regimen August 1st. In Wisconsin this is before ragweed pollen was peaking. I would take 3 Allerplex pills with breakfast and 2 Fermented Cod Liver oil pills by Blue Ice I would repeat that dosage for lunch for the first 2 weeks.I had zero allergy symptoms. Then the ragweed peaked around August 16th with a very high count for a few days. I had slightly itchy eyes in the morning with a sneeze here or there. But nothing major. Had to blow my nose a little more than usual for a few days. So I started taking 3 pills for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and then with a snack in the evening for a few days.My symptoms are gone again. It’s August 21st now, and for the last 3 days, not one sneeze. No itchy eyes, stuffy nose, etc.  Nothing!So I lowered my frequency again only taking 3 Allerplex in the morning and 2 fermented cod liver oil for the last 3-4 days. Still no symptoms.I monitor the pollen count daily. And it is very high for ragweed.I saw my neighbor outside when I got home from work today and she was sneezing. I asked her if it was allergies. She said they were horrible for her right now. And my symptoms are gone! Naturally I had to tell her about Allerplex! So amazing! Standard Process has really changed my life in such a wonderful way. I tell my wife that I have to tell the whole world about this product!Just remember, let this product work through your body for a couple weeks. It may not work overnight. But it has been a game changer for me. I will never by an OTC allergy pill for the rest of my life. No side effects whatsoever! How could you go wrong?One last statistic I read about Allerplex in conjunction with fermented cod liver oil is that this combination works for 95% of people. As bad as my allergies were before Allerplex and as good as I feel now, I truly believe it. Allerplex 6-12 daily, Fermented Cod Liver Oil 3-6 daily. Everyone is different so monitor your body cuz no one knows it better than you. If no symptoms take less. If symptoms are bad take a bit more.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ky6WFVE+L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SE7qnSdsL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41GF96a4QFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41W3JOSy9IL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Lzhq7mW7L._AC_.jpg

The past few years they have been so bad that I was in constant pain most of the year. No allergy medicine helped. I had intense pain behind my eyes, severe congestion that lead to daily migraines and jaw/teeth pain.  I went to a chiropractor a few months ago for a non-related issue and discussed my migraines and sever allergies to him. Much to my surprise he was able to literally cure my sinus/allergy issues simply by suggesting I start taking Allerplex.  The bottle says to take 3 per meal. He said I should just take 1 per meal (3x day). Immediately I started seeing and feeling results. I'm now down to ONE Allerplex a day and the chiropractor said I can probably eventually come off them for good because my system should stabilize and not over-react to allergens or even insect bites as drastically as it was.  Even more proof that this supplement works wonders - I got bit on my toe by a fire ant last week - in the past my entire foot would swell up so badly that I couldn't even get a shoe on. Now that I've been using Allerplex, the bit swelled up, but nothing more than like a mosquito bite. It did sting and was irritating for a few days, but, in comparison to how I used to react to one bite, that was minimal!!!!!!!  I can now mow my entire yard and there is no more suffering afterwards. I used to be so allergic to grass, dust, pollen that any time in my yard - especially mowing - would have me sick in bed the entire next day.  As I said, Allerplex is truly a life changer. I cannot thank my chiropractor enough for his recommendation of this product! Seriously, if you have any allergy issues, BUY THIS PRODUCT!

I always read reviews before purchasing on Amazon so I thought this might help someone who isn't convinced.  I purchased Congaplex a few years ago when a friend told me to use it for sinus issues...works like a charm when I feel a cold coming on.  I have always had sinus issues and then allergies to pollen/dust etc developed in my late 20's.  My 70 year old father has undergone 3 sinus surgery's in his lifetime (in fact I should buy him a bottle too!).  The reason for the background is that I feel i'm quite experienced when it comes to otc and prescription sinus medication, allergy meds, nasal irrigation, z packs, etc.So about a year ago I bought another bottle of congaplex and on a whim I read the reviews for Allerplex and bought a bottle.  It sat in my cupboard for the past year...I continued on my zyrtec and nasal sprays thinking this stuff really can't battle these springtime allergies.  About 8 weeks ago my nasal congestion was horrible...and I knew the instant my medication wore out...I couldn't breathe...so I got back on the nasal sprays...again I knew exactly when they wore out too.  Finally, I thought what the heck let's try the allerplex.  It really is amazing! no more nasal congestion!!! Funny I usually sneeze about 4 times around 10:30 in the morning and i'm fine the rest of the day. Plus I just read another review before writing this and they described their chronic watery eyes...I've always had that issue...EVERY spring...and completely forgot about it because I've had maybe one morning with watery eyes!  There are no side effects whatsoever.  I take 2 or 3 in the morning and 2 or 3 before bed.

I don't believe I am growing out of my allergies, but I do believe that this product has helped my body to build up tolerances to the things that agitate my allergies (ragweed, hay, grass, pets, etc.). I now live comfortably with both a dog and cat and enjoy the outdoors when the weather is nice. I keep the Allerplex on hand just in case and have rarely had to use it this season.

Let me tell you that this supplement has done wonders for BOTH of my dogs.  It has helped Beau with his food allergies - no more yucky ears and his skin is cleared up - no more scabs and scratching.  Tank is doing exceptionally better with his seasonal allergies too.  If I stop giving this to my dogs they both go right back to the breakouts and miserable scratching.  I have spent hundreds of $ on Vets for Beaus allergies - ear cleaners - special food etc...  and nothing ever worked.  I was giving Tank & Beau both Benadryl with minimal results.  They were both frequently miserable.  Not anymore!Allerplex is going to be a staple in my house.  I 100% recommend this product!LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  Not only does it work - but its affordable as well.Finally Something that works!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ky6WFVE+L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SE7qnSdsL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41GF96a4QFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41W3JOSy9IL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Lzhq7mW7L._AC_.jpg

Still, these seem gentle in their effect. I am happy I found them (did so because I'm a tea lover and saw this ingredient in multiple sleep teas).

Now, I'm no scientist, but I swear these little guys did something good for my brain. My focus felt sharper, especially on those crazy busy days when my to-do list was longer than a CVS receipt. Lion's Mane is supposed to be the brain's best friend, and coupled with the chill vibes from Ashwagandha, it's like a match made in gummy heaven.But wait, there's more! They're not just for the brainiacs out there. Some days, I swear they helped with my memory, giving me that extra edge when I needed to remember where I left my keys or the name of that movie from the '90s.And let's not forget about sleep quality. These gummies didn't exactly knock me out like a horse tranquilizer, but I did notice I slept a bit more soundly on the nights I took them. Maybe it's the Reishi mushroom doing its thing—I don't know, but I'll take it!Oh, and mood? Yeah, they get a gold star for that too. I felt like I had a little pep in my step, even on those gloomy Mondays when the coffee just wasn't cutting it.Now, let's address the elephant in the room—smell. Okay, I won't lie, when you first open the bottle, there's a bit of a funky mushroom smell. But don't let that scare you off! Once you pop one in your mouth, it's all sweet, fruity goodness.And did I mention they're gummies? Yeah, you heard that right. No pills to swallow here—just delicious, chewy goodness.

I think they help minimally but nothing super noticeable. I have tried those greens powders and could not notice any difference. I will try to post an update as I have only been taking for a few days but I can honestly say I think this is a game changer for me. I noticed a difference ever since the first day. As many others have stated I found I can only take 1 of these and it needs to be very early in the morning like by 7:30/8am. The first day I took it at 10:30am and then forgot I took it. Later in the afternoon I noticed I was not feeling sluggish at all and actually the opposite then it dawned on me I had take this supplement. I was not able to sleep well that night just wide awake and mind buzzing. I took it early in the morning the next 2 days and sleep was better. I am going to take a break from it over the weekend and see if I feel any different. Also I will add that I am neurodivergent (I don't take medication for this) and I honestly feel like it helping me be more focused and actually able to complete tasks instead of having decision fatigue. I have been very productive the last few days and very good mood. I do get seasonal depression and the daylight is quickly fading here plus it has been overcast and rainy for several days now so normally I would be very lazy and no energy but that has not been the case since taking this supplement. So far I am incredibly impressed. I have always thought I had some hormonal imbalances or something making me have lower energy and the past year I have put on weight that's been very difficult to lose (once I hit 30 it really hit). I am really hoping that continuing this supplement will help keep me more active and being able to complete more projects and tasks which I normally struggle with. I'm also hoping with the increased energy it will help me lose the weight I have gained over the last year. I'll try to post an update in a few weeks but I definitely recommend giving this a try, so far I really like it! I think I actually could use a lower dose. I am curious to see long term if its something your body gets used to and you need more to be as effective or not.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416qIoehYdL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oN56G-UwL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGzi2vuCL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4165aKQtC3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wSHGxypKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417T8MnXS2L._AC_.jpg

Pretty cool, subtle results",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2018",True,"I have used this product for about two weeks with subtle but good results. I take one capsule in the morning and on a few occasions I took a second capsule in the evening.  I have not tried two capsules at once and I’ll explain why further down.  For an understanding of my physiology and health, I eat very healthy (close to a paleo diet with a few changes) and I’m very active.  I take creatine and not on any health medication.  I also work and in school.This supplement has a subtle effect on me.  This does not have a strong or immediately noticeable result once taken.  However, I did notice an increase in stamina and less fatigue when I was doing fast, high incline, hiking (I would say results felt similar to creatine but much less effective).  I also felt it helped me feel less fatigued on a few days when I was getting less than my normal amount of sleep.  I would like to try this stuff on a night shift rotation but I haven’t had the chance yet.It is important to remember everyone’s physiology is different and other factors like diet and health will impact how a supplement will work for different people.  Not everyone is going to get the same result and that is not necessarily the fault of the product (or the person).  For me, I noticed a mild improvement in the stamina and reduced fatigue, but I didn’t notice until taking it for a few days.  I’m not sure if you need to build this up in the system for a few days for effectiveness but I’m trying to test that now and will update later if I have anything to add.I would caution that if you have a weak or sensitive stomach you should be cautious with Rhodiola Rosea Extract.  It doesn’t have a pleasant taste and even though it is in capsule form, it caused a little stomach gas for me on a few occasions and I could smell / taste it which is not pleasant. For this reason I never wanted to take more than one pill at a time.  I didn’t have this experience every time, but it happened at least half the time, on an empty stomach or with a meal.  Having said that, it is not terrible either and I would argue if you are burning the candle at both ends, this may be effective in helping you balance out.  I don’t feel I need this daily but would use building up for finals or as needed.Also, I did not notice cognitive benefits while taking this and studying.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416qIoehYdL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oN56G-UwL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGzi2vuCL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4165aKQtC3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wSHGxypKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417T8MnXS2L._AC_.jpg

However, as a serotonin promoter, R. rosea shouldn't be taken with SSRIs, 5-htp, or L-theanine, because excessive serotonin can cause ""serotonin syndrome"", the effects of which are the opposite of what you want out of it, such as insomnia.  It also lowers blood pressure, a positive for some but not all, and slightly increases heart rate; however, huperzine A (a promoter of acetylcholine) does the opposite.

I rated this five stars for the formula as opposed to the delivery mechanism. I take the sprayer out and use a dropper to add it to water.

Most sleep herbs are bitter and unpleasant. This is the best I've used so far and the flavor is decent.

This stuff is great.Let me tell you what I've had to take to go to sleep before trying this Minding Down supplement:1) Qunol Sleep Support 5 in 12) 15 mg Melatonin3) CBD (which I quit taking two months ago)4) I sleep with several palm stones in my bed. I have to hold stones in my hands or I can't sleep (something to try if you're desperate to sleep, but can't. Try amethyst, rose quartz, malachite, or selenite.)5) Theta wave binaural sleep music6) A humidifierNow it's just Minding Down and the palm stones (and the music and the humidifier - gotta have those).

I didn't believe that a cream could help you destress and relax or even help you get back to sleep. I was almost afraid to try it just in case it was true! So I did the safest thing possible, I used half the dosage before bedtime. As I sat in bed reading for a few minutes as I always do I was overcome by a feeling of ""end of the day"" relief. I never finished reading that page. In the morning, I found my book on the floor. I never have sleep problems but that night I had barely been in bed a few minutes before my lights went out and that was on half a dose. At the next opportunity I got brave and used a half dose in the middle of the day. It felt like i had a midday pause for a cup of tea! It did not make me sleepy but I did feel renewed and less stressed to continue the rest of the day.  From that point I experimented with dosing depending on how stressed I was feeling.I like the idea of a topical cream. I can keep it in my purse and not worry it's going to spill like liquid drops. HealthyGut products are non GMO, they have no fillers and they use a cGMP facility. However, I don't see information about 3rd party lab testing. In my opinion that is probably the most important certification. you can have. Lastly, unfortunately these supplements from Healthy Gut are very overpriced especially lacking some important certifications.  That really limits the customer base who will no doubt go elsewhere until they find an answer as the founders did in their 'story'.

It’s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it’s hard for me to get a “full” dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there’s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don’t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally — the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don’t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I’d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I’ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it’s such a strange combination of flavors I’m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.  In a pinch I would use this but I think I’d prefer a pill or just a simple elderberry gummy instead.  Just my preference anyway.

The bottle includes an eye dropper cap that is used to deliver the recommended 2 dropper full of the liquid. The ingredients includes extracts of echinacea, elderberry, thyme, sage, yarrow, and lemon balm in a proprietary combination. The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity. The liquid tastes quite bad so I recommend adding the 2 dropper full to some juice. I appreciate that it's made in the USA. I find the price point for 20 days supply to be rather steep.

It has a bold, flavorful taste and is made with high-quality organic ingredients such as poppy from California, blue vervain, tart cherry, elderberry, and hawthorn. It has a bold flavor that is described as sweet and fruity, with a mild cinnamon undertone. The supplement comes in a 4.07oz bottle and has 100 servings.Overall, the Apothekary Wine Down is a natural supplement that can help individuals unwind and prepare for a restful night's sleep. Its unique blend of herbal extracts and lack of common allergens make it an attractive option for those looking for a safe and effective way to relax and improve sleep quality.I have to admit that when I first heard about Apothekary Wine Down, I was a bit skeptical about its claims of being ""wine replacement"" and promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality. I've tried other supplements in the past that promised similar benefits, but ultimately fell short of delivering on their promises. However, after giving Wine Down a try for several nights in a row, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. I like the flavor and easy-to-take formula made it a breeze to incorporate into my bedtime routine, and I found myself feeling more relaxed and calm than usual. I noticed that I was sleeping better and waking up feeling more refreshed, which was a great bonus.

And this tincture, when it touches my tongue, spreads a wonderful taste over it- and a quick moment later, there is a slow burn that begins and remains for a bit after.Wine Down comes in a lovely dark white colored glass bottle (not see through, white glass) with a dropper attached to the cap. Both the bottle and dropper are glass and both, the very best quality. The directions tell you to squeeze one drop on or under the tongue and let sit for ten seconds. If you don't like the taste however, you can put it in a drink. You are told in these directions you can take this tincture up to four times a day.When I took Wine Down, I felt the effects quickly- within a couple minutes, and in all honesty, it does have a very good calming effect. It worked so well I took to taking it with me during the day and taking it when I needed to relax. I wouldn't  say Wine Down is terribly intense though, it's just something that actually helped me to relax- as if before I couldn't quote catch my breath and after- well, there was no longer that problem.Wine Down is something that I will definitely be using in the future, because, for me, there were so many positive effects- not only did the tincture relax me but when I took it before bed, it also helped to get me to sleep better- during my “wind down” time (and now this is my “Wine Down” time ;).I am really in love with this product, I don't go anywhere without it (just in case I need it) and have never been so happy to have chosen this product to review on Amazon as- it would have never been something that I tried on my own!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31esPkojpzL._AC_.jpg

The first time I ordered a bottle I got Liquid Phyto-Capsules, the second time I ordered I recived capsules that seemed to either have powder in them or the liquid has dried up. The date on the bottle says 10/19, so I'm pretty sure they're not expired. I've been taking them like I normally would, but it's just...odd, because I know they're not supposed to look like this (unless they've changed?). I will still order these, I'm just confused. Hopefully I won't get sick or anything, I have 34 capsules left and I take two every morning.UPDATE: 6/12/17So I ordered another bottle a few days ago and received the bottle, to which on the box it stated that it was a new and improved formula. The capsules looked exactly like the ones that inspired me to write this review, they looked like the capsules in the picture. So the company finally got around to making it official that they changed the formula, on the box. I can't say for sure if this new formula works better than the old one, as I was sure that they were onto something with the liquid inside the capsule. Oh well.
