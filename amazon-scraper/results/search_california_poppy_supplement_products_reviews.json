  "text": "I first heard of California Poppy for pain in 2012 when a segment on Dr. Oz discussed this item.  But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.  They are NOT like a drugs related to poppy flowers (heroin).  They have not shown up during urine drug testing at work.",

The other day I was cooking up a storm and had been in the kitchen for hours, my feet and back were hurting. I took a couple of these babies and before I knew it the foot pain was gone, I felt good enough to go for an hour and a half drive and visit with my daughter (she was up late settling into her own place). Mind you I didn't get back home till 2 o'clock in the morning and I felt pretty good pain wise. That was my first time taking this supplement, now I usually take 2 or 3 at a time- once or twice a day- depending on how bad I feel, I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I saw that the Medical Medium has a California poppy seed shock therapy in his new Brain Protocols book and will give that a try soon.",

  "text": "This supplement did not help my back pain when my back went out so I'm not sure what type of pain relief it is capable of giving. However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep. So don't be surprised if you sleep longer than normal.~The Rebecca Review",

  "text": "I researched California Poppy in regard to anxiety and trouble sleeping. I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier. I gave some to my husband to try and he had a crazy dream that left him rattled, so it's probably not for everyone but for me it works.",

The poppy  seems to help me wake up on time and be more alert, not over sleep, so it may be helping the quality of  sleep. I dislike the high alcohol level and the taste is truly vile, that is the reason for four stars. Herb Pharm has proved to be a reliable company of quality extracts but they don't make California Poppy in a glycerin, non alcohol form.

  "text": "I have a very high tolerance for benzodiazepines from years of being prescribed for insomnia, so I researched my problem and landed on studies of  Eschscholzia californica.  As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are \"Alcohol 62%\" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.  THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSUMING BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT.",

  "text": "I saw the many positive reviews on here and read some various literature online touting the wonderful relaxing effects of California poppy extract. I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain. I suppose it works for some people, but it definitely didn't do a thing for me.",

  "text": "It\u2019s a Friday night, and I\u2019m staring at a mountain of laundry that seems more like Everest after a long week. Normally, I\u2019d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different\u2014a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I\u2019d heard these were supposed to be nature\u2019s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn\u2019t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity\u2014who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I\u2019d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn\u2019t feel groggy or out of it\u2014just calm, focused, and oddly energized. Even my usual Saturday errands felt less like a chore and more like a leisurely stroll through the day.",

  "text": "First of I do love poppyseed. As a European it is common to have it come in breads and other bakery items. It seems to have a calming effect and that's what I expected from this supplement as well with the added benefit of the wild lettuce. I have taken it for a couple of days now. It certainly didn't knock me out and that is not supposed to be in any way. But it helps me to fall asleep more natural and I have no quarrels about that.",

I use a few different products which I rotate every three days, since that seems to keep their effects potent.  I had never tried wild lettuce or California poppy extract before.  I'm happy to say that taking two of these capsules before bedtime has been VERY effective at helping me get to sleep.  I mean they work like a dang charm!  I could almost believe these had THAT kind of poppy in them (they do no actually have that kind of poppy. \ud83d\ude42)  I'm happy to have these on hand, as they have proven so far to be a surefire knockout inducer.  I still need to resort to something more powerful if I've had caffeine or B vitamins too late in the day, but for everyday use these are a winner.",

I struggle with a lot of chronic pain that is made worse by tension and anxiety, it's like a vicious cycle so I wanted to find something to help break that cycle and hopefully help my body and mind relax.  I decided to give these a try and I am super glad I did.  The first time I took these I started to relax and my muscles started to loosen and some of the pain eased up and in turned eased my mind.....these are now a regular supplement, especially while I wait to be scheduled for hip replacement (yeah....ouch).  I sleep better now and that helps immensely!  I'll be back for more!",

Unfortunately I had no relief and the tast3 is one of those that makes arm hair stand up and gave me w fit of the heabie jeebies.  Its very caustic in the mouth, I felt a burning sensation.  My advice is to order outside of amazon a broad spectrum cbd oil or tincture I encourage contacting a local dispensary or online delivery service.  I should listen to my own advice more and will because this isn't returnable nor refundable that's a big chunk  of change I don't anymore.  So read small print and order BROAD SPECTRUM CBD.

I find it effective for happier sleep but do not see much difference for severe OA pain. I like quality of this brand, the taste is very pleasant & it\u2019s well packaged.

I am never used poppy before so I don\u2019t know exactly how I should use it and wish they provided better direction.  It doesn\u2019t say to use it before bed and doesn\u2019t warn about using it while driving or doing other things that require your attention.  I am taking one in the morning and it is too soon to see if I feel more relaxed during the day or sleep better.  I put a photo against another bottle to show that it comes in a bottle about half the size of other bottles.  I applaud the company for this as too often you get a lot of unnecessary packaging and this company seems to be sensitive to that issue.",

( i don,t think that there are any quick fixes in herbal medicine)  The quality, i have used a number of tinctures from this company and they all seem to be of high quality, i have every confidence in them. As for the taste, most herbal tinctures taste awful. (why would anyone think it would taste nice?) However the taste is not that bad and is quite easily masked in a drink of some sort. If you are suffering with insomnia and/or anxiety, this is well worth a try. It is more effective mixed with other calming herbs than on its own though.",

  "text": "At first, I thought this product was working well. California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called \u201cglutamate\u201d which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don\u2019t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you\u2019re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I\u2019ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",

  "text": "I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",

I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night.

Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste. So this California Poppy extract would be effective for occasional sleepless nights. I cannot offer an opinion about long term results.",

Though, my one concern is quality of consistency. I will purchase a few more times before I come to a conclusion and comment definitely on consistency though. I say this because it would be nice to just invest in the 64oz, so long as shelf life doesn\u2019t play a roll in keeping kava long term.",

  "text": "I had a sleep aid I loved which had lavender essential oil in half the capsule and powder herbs in the other.  It was diluted, of course.  It worked better than anything else I used at the time.  Then they seemed to have stopped making it.  I have missed that.  This, however, is a close second!HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a bottle which is glass, not plastic.  I am partial to those.CAPSULESThese are pressed pills with a dividing line down the center if you want to cut them in half.  They break easily.CONTENTSI love what is in these, but did want to point out that sometimes certain herbs will register positive on drug tests.  I know of some people who ate poppy seed cookies or cakes that had false positives, so check on that prior to using these if that is a concern to you.  Otherwise the ingredients in this are pretty nice.SMELL/FLAVORThis has lavender in it.  I do occasionally burp up lavender after taking with a meal.  I love it so it does not bother me.  It might bother some people.DIGESTIONI had no issues with digestion other than occasional burps with lavender usually only once and that is it.DO THEY WORK?I must say these do seem to work well to not only help me sleep , but help me go back to sleep even after having to go to the bathroom at night.GROGGY?I don't feel groggy when I wake up, but I do feel rested.THE BOTTOM LINEI like these a lot.  I will definitely consider a repurchase.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  These are my new favorite sleep aid for natural sleep assistance.  I am really happy to have found a lavender based supplement again as it does seem to help a lot.",

I do know that with herbs the quality is what matters and depends on where they are grown, how they are grown and lastly how they are processed. The herbs themselves are generally good but as I said where, How grown and processed determines if the product is high quality or low quality. I\u2019m an herbalist so I anyalize things quite thoroughly. I saw no improvement by trying this product.",

  "text": "I am someone who has always had trouble falling and staying asleep and I\u2019ve tried countless products over the years.Something as basic as melatonin never really worked well for me, and I don\u2019t like highly addictive medication\u2018s either, so I always look for a happy medium.When I came across this product, it had such a great list of high-quality ingredients and when I looked its contents up online, they seemed promising.I went ahead and placed an order for them and they arrived pretty quickly.They come in really heavy duty glass jar which almost shattered on the floor because I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so heavy when I slid it out of the box.As far as the pills themselves, they are a bit large in size.Normally, I would suggest breaking them in half, but the taste is so horrible to begin with that when you break them in half it\u2019s even worse.They are very abrasive, and taking them with a lot of water, it\u2019s still hard to avoid the harness of the flavor, at least for me.Some people may not have as big of an issue with it as I do, but for me, it\u2019s just overbearing.I haven\u2019t really noticed that much of a difference in my sleep pattern either.I don\u2019t fall asleep any faster, but I seem to sleep a little more solid during the night so I maybe can chalk that up to these.But, for the little bit of difference and sleep, it\u2019s not really worth the horrible flavor plus the high price tag.I do feel that for this price point There are much better supplements out there that will help you get a good nights sleep.I hope my review helps you to make a more well informed decision.",

  "text": "This glass bottle contains one month of supplements. The bottle says it's tested by a third party, but there's very little information about the product on the packaging itself. Instead, there's a QR code to give you that information. These do not contain any melatonin and use products including lavender and poppy seed to help lull you to sleep. It's important to note that none of these products' effectiveness has been studied or backed up by the FDA.On that note, I replaced my regular melatonin and sleep aid combo to see if I was able to get quality sleep. Unfortunately, after trying for a week, I went back to my old standby. The taste of the lavender was too much for me, but I thought it was worth it if I got better sleep. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I've since given these to my husband to try, but he rarely has sleep issues so these may expire before he gets the chance to use them.They might work for some, but they didn't do much for me (that I could tell, anyway).",

  "text": "Metagenics is a supplement brand I trust for quality. I\u2019ve purchased them thru medical practitioner initially, so I this melatonin-free formula intrigued me. Admittedly, falling asleep has never been my strong suit. And melatonin makes me feel terrible. I tried it for 2 nights. I started with one tablet. The challenge for me is that it really tastes like Lavender-it\u2019s overpowering. The first night I took after my evening meal & tasted the lavender the rest of the night. I can say it seemed to having a calming effect. The 2nd night I took in the middle of my meal and the taste lingered less so. Again, felt calming effect without a groggy morning feeling. The fragrance from the bottle is so strong that I had to remove it from my kitchen where I store my supplement as it\u2019s like having a lavender sachet in a drawer. So while I think I liked the calming effects of the formula, sadly I\u2019m unable to continue taking, because the lavender is too disruptive. It\u2019s really unfortunate- hope they consider reformulating with less lavender or no lavender as the other ingredient are compelling.",

  "text": "I was excited to see a Metagenics product to try as this is a very high quality brand. It has a good blend of ingredients, but way too many additives/excipients in my opinion. I\u2019m also not a fan of the lavender as the taste is way too strong and it can affect estrogen levels.As an herbalist, I really appreciate the California poppy (mildly pain relieving in addition to sedating), passionflower (great for calming a racing mind and soothing the body), and jujube (which has similar properties to the passionflower).If this didn\u2019t have the lavender and had cleaner/less excipients, this would be something I would enjoy taking more regularly. I also noticed I had to take extra on one particular night where I was struggling to sleep, but it did eventually help.",

  "text": "This product is absolutely amazing. Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",

How is that even possible? I have no idea. I take 100ml before bed, rather than the recommeded 70ml.  It does seem to help me relax and get to sleep more easily.  I do not take it for pain.

In the wake of a challenging situation, my emotions today were very weighty. I feel sad most of the day, and used the poppy tea for the first time this evening. I feel calm, gentle and at peace. Even a little fuzzy, which is not a great description for some people but it explains how I feel. The taste is somewhat grassy, and almost has a warm mouth feel (not like licorice root, way more subtle). I enjoyed it, and I\u2019m enjoying the relaxing feeling of it now.",
