  "text": "The California poppy tea is great. It\u2019s quite a small bag, which would feel more acceptable if the seller didn\u2019t send it along with a HUGE sample of some other tea I never asked for. Thanks for the sample, but I have a ton of black tea already. It feels like compensating for how tiny the package I actually ordered is? Just send me a little bit more of the thing I actually wanted to get from you, instead of a massive sample of something else. That\u2019s my hot take.",

  "text": "I researched California Poppy in regard to anxiety and trouble sleeping. I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier. I gave some to my husband to try and he had a crazy dream that left him rattled, so it's probably not for everyone but for me it works.",

  "text": "I have used this as sleep enhancing remedy for several months and find it quite effective. I tried Californai Poppy capsules and they do not do the job. I take one dropper full  of this extract in a cup of chamomile tea about an hour before sleep. Straight chamomile does nothing. The poppy  seems to help me wake up on time and be more alert, not over sleep, so it may be helping the quality of  sleep. I dislike the high alcohol level and the taste is truly vile, that is the reason for four stars. Herb Pharm has proved to be a reliable company of quality extracts but they don't make California Poppy in a glycerin, non alcohol form. I still recommend this and suggest putting it in an herb tea to avoid the taste.",

  "text": "I have a very high tolerance for benzodiazepines from years of being prescribed for insomnia, so I researched my problem and landed on studies of  Eschscholzia californica.  As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are \"Alcohol 62%\" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.  THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSUMING BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT.",

  "text": "I saw the many positive reviews on here and read some various literature online touting the wonderful relaxing effects of California poppy extract. I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain. I suppose it works for some people, but it definitely didn't do a thing for me.",

In the wake of a challenging situation, my emotions today were very weighty. I feel sad most of the day, and used the poppy tea for the first time this evening. I feel calm, gentle and at peace. Even a little fuzzy, which is not a great description for some people but it explains how I feel. The taste is somewhat grassy, and almost has a warm mouth feel (not like licorice root, way more subtle). I enjoyed it, and I\u2019m enjoying the relaxing feeling of it now.",

I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier. I gave some to my husband to try and he had a crazy dream that left him rattled, so it's probably not for everyone but for me it works.",

  "text": "I have used this as sleep enhancing remedy for several months and find it quite effective. I tried Californai Poppy capsules and they do not do the job. I take one dropper full  of this extract in a cup of chamomile tea about an hour before sleep. Straight chamomile does nothing. The poppy  seems to help me wake up on time and be more alert, not over sleep, so it may be helping the quality of  sleep. I dislike the high alcohol level and the taste is truly vile, that is the reason for four stars. Herb Pharm has proved to be a reliable company of quality extracts but they don't make California Poppy in a glycerin, non alcohol form. I still recommend this and suggest putting it in an herb tea to avoid the taste.",

  "text": "I have a very high tolerance for benzodiazepines from years of being prescribed for insomnia, so I researched my problem and landed on studies of  Eschscholzia californica.  As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are \"Alcohol 62%\" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.  THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSUMING BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT.",

  "text": "I saw the many positive reviews on here and read some various literature online touting the wonderful relaxing effects of California poppy extract. I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain. I suppose it works for some people, but it definitely didn't do a thing for me.",

The other day I was cooking up a storm and had been in the kitchen for hours, my feet and back were hurting. I took a couple of these babies and before I knew it the foot pain was gone, I felt good enough to go for an hour and a half drive and visit with my daughter (she was up late settling into her own place). Mind you I didn't get back home till 2 o'clock in the morning and I felt pretty good pain wise. That was my first time taking this supplement, now I usually take 2 or 3 at a time- once or twice a day- depending on how bad I feel, I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I saw that the Medical Medium has a California poppy seed shock therapy in his new Brain Protocols book and will give that a try soon.",

  "text": "This supplement did not help my back pain when my back went out so I'm not sure what type of pain relief it is capable of giving. However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep. So don't be surprised if you sleep longer than normal.~The Rebecca Review",

Sorry I didn't order from Bio Nutrition but they were going to take too long to deliver so I ordered from Hawaii Pharm ... turns out I would have received Bio Nutrition earlier.

  "text": "I bought this set after buying Nighty Night from the grocery store and absolutely falling in love with it. I wanted to try the extra strength version that the store didn't carry and decided to get the variety pack here. I'll return with my thoughts on each flavor as I try them but wanted to go ahead and leave my feedback because I've loved my experience so far.\ud83c\udf19Nighty Night: A very full tea with a delicious and refreshing minty lilt. Drinking this tea is one of the few things I look forward to eveyday and while it doesn't have a sleepy affect it does work well to calm my nerves before bed.\ud83d\udca4Nighty Night Extra: Very similar to Nighty Night but also contains valerian root. Valerian root has a very distinct and rather unpleasant smell but it's flavor isn't unpleasant, it reminds me of dandelion tea. Extra had a bit more body than regular Nighty Night and had the same affect on my sleepiness.\ud83c\udf43Lavender mint: This makes me feel like I'm drinking camomile tea. The distinctive floral taste of lavender coupled with refreshing mint is absolutely glorious. Perfect balance of flavors where the lavender is not too flowery, the mint not too electric\u2026 overall a very smoothing experience \ud83d\ude0c\ud83e\uddd8Camomile Lavender: Unlike the Lavender Mint the Lavender is a bit too overpowering for the camomile. For me, it's a bit too flowery and bitter in a way I can only balance with another less floral tea. Ideally I'd use another camomile but I didn't have any so I used the Nighty Night and while the Lavender is still very strong it's less biting.\ud83e\uded6Cinnamon: I'll be honest, I was NOT looking forward to trying this one. While I love a spicy ginger tea, cinnamon ain my thing \ud835\udcf1\ud835\udcf8\ud835\udd00\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcff\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcfb, I paired it with a generous splash of banana pudding whisky, strawberry gin, a spoonful of jujubes in honey tea and it was absolutely heavenly, buttery even. The cinnamon alone is actually rather pleasant, I was expecting it to be overpowering but it's not at all, more of a twange than in your face. It can actually lean fruity if you want it to, maybe throw in some lemon juice or peach tea. It could also go floral but I went the more cakey route and think this would be great to deepen the flavor profile of a butter beer or hot cocoa. Though it stands it's own it's definitely a more subdued tea than the others.\ud83c\udf4bLemon balm: Though lemon balm is part of the mint family it's definitely more citrusy in flavor than minty. It does however have a slightly minty aftertaste that's closest to spearmint in flavor and is easier to detect if you exhale through your nose between sips. This is the mildest of the tea flavors in this variety pack though it absolutely does have its own charm the slight lemony taste of this tea had me craving more. It tastes very much like lemon zest so while it's distinctly lemony tasting it's not super tangy. I decided to add a bag of lemon ginger tea with a couple splashes of lime to deepen and round out the perfectly cirtusy experience.To sum everything up my favorite was definitely the Lavender Mint with Nighty Night coming in at a very close second. If you're having issues with insomnia these teas unfortunately are not the answer but they are certainly useful in setting the stage for a restful night's sleep which is a fundamental part of good sleep hygiene. I personally have found cbn and indica gummies to be very useful and will mix them in my tea to amplify the calming affect of the tea and the sleepy affect of the gummies in this oddly perfect synergy that has my eyelids drooping before I can even finish the cup. I hope my review was helpful, happy steeping \ud83d\ude0c",

  "text": "It's still far too soon to say what benefits this might give me but one thing is sure, it most CERTAINLY gets you going! Now it's not an immediate thing so be patient and use caution and DON'T do what I did.I had me a nice cuppa wen it came and waited several hours (5? 6?) and nothing had happened yet. I thought, maybe I brewed it too weak. So I made a second cup before I laid down to sleep. I slept about 3 hours and woke up to intense pain and the need to GO!I raced to the bathroom and it was not like other over the counter laxatives that makes things watery and loose. Nooo, this was solid and urgent and painful and I felt heat wash over me and like I was going to throw up at the same time. Almost as if I had food poisoning kind of feeling. I remember closing my eyes once I had some relief (after I'd been sweating because of it and not from strain, no no... one does not strain and push too hard or else you have other problems to deal with). The next thing I know I am half-way waking up and not sure where I was or how I got there or what day it was.I had fainted somehow. Passed out cold and fallen off the toilet over beside it wedged between the toilet and the sink cabinet. Even after finally deducing where I was you would think I would try to get up. No. I couldn't. I was utterly without energy and strength and felt drugged. I don't think my eyes even completely opened. I fell back to 'sleep' there for who knows how long since I was at home alone. When I finally could wake and move I had to 'go' again and feared passing out, again. Luckily I didn't. Once business was handled on the toilet I got a shower and laid down for a few more hours and was woken with pains again.No passing out this time and it wasn't as painful but there was still discomfort. Stool was more loose and liquid this time but briefer. And so it's been off and on all night/morning for me.Moral of the story....Drink one or even only half a cup the first time and wait... WAIT! Even if you have to wait overnight, for the love of all that's holy wait. Otherwise you too might feel like you are dying and end up passed out in your bathroom floor. it does what it says it does. It cleans you out but be patient with that process or suffer the consequences.",

Noticed no difference, maybe a little cramping but thats it. Next day comes (Thurs) and I remembered someone wrote that they let their tea bag sit in water for about 30 min or so\u2026 Tried it (around 11am) and by the end of the day\u2026.. let me just say I\u2019ve been to the restroom atleast 3-4x. The next day (friday) comes and I\u2019m still running to  the restroom so I decided not to drink it that day and see how long it takes for it to pass. Maybe next time I wont let it sit for too long or maybe it\u2019s just something I ate?? I will update at the end of week to see if I\u2019ve lost any weight but something works?",

Para mantener el peso se recomienda tomarlo 1 vez al d\u00eda y para perder Peso se debe tomar 2 veces al d\u00eda ( nunca exceder 2 tazas por d\u00eda)Debe estar preparado para ir al ba\u00f1o a cualquier hora y en cualquier momento. Da muchos c\u00f3licos y malestares de est\u00f3mago pero sin duda lo recomiendo. Lo voy a continuar usando un mes completo descansando los fines de semana. Luego de ese tiempo actualizo el comentario para compartir mis resultados. Comenc\u00e9 con 154 libras, ahora estoy pensando 147.",

  "text": "I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night. Both poppy extract and a few bong loads of wild lettuce have proved to be effective for my occasional sleep or minor pain problems.",

This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste.

  "text": "These golden poppy seeds are absolutely SUPERB! I read online that poppy seeds required stratification for better and successful germination rate. So I stored in fridge for three weeks immediately after it was received. I loosen and prepared the soil prior before the rainstorm arrives in Southern California in early April, 2024. I carefully spray the seeds evenly by hand to covered the entire perimeter, then spray another very thin layer of good organic soil on top the seeds for good contact. The effort has paid off after just 13 days in ground. I read online that young juvenile poppy plants might not bloom on first year, but we will see!",

My advice is to order outside of amazon a broad spectrum cbd oil or tincture I encourage contacting a local dispensary or online delivery service.  I should listen to my own advice more and will because this isn't returnable nor refundable that's a big chunk  of change I don't anymore.  So read small print and order BROAD SPECTRUM CBD.

  "text": "I first heard of California Poppy for pain in 2012 when a segment on Dr. Oz discussed this item.  But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.  They are NOT like a drugs related to poppy flowers (heroin).  They have not shown up during urine drug testing at work.",

  "text": "I love this brand and keep all the flavors in stock in my cupboard. I go to the Pure Mind blend on days when I have a lot of tasks to do. I can\u2019t say that it helps me focus specifically any better than I would have, but just starting my day drinking this with good intention does 100% help me motivate and stay on task.Some people comment about the powder in the packets that shake loose from the bags. I find this is always the case when I order it by mail\u2026 it always comes to me in a paper or plastic mailer that takes a beating in transit. I have never had this problem when I buy it in stores though, so definitely a shipping issue. But I don\u2019t mind the excess powder.Be careful when opening the packets, my boyfriend has a habit of ripping it lower than the tear line sometimes and you will rip the tea bag open this way .Taste 2.5/5Ingredients 5/5I find the flavor bland with a light taste of oregano. To combat the bland flavor , I usually steep my bags in conjunction with other more flavorful tea varieties.Overall, Highly recommend",

This effect seemed to subside to some extent as I continue to take it, but it still seems more powerful than most of the other brands I've tried.",

  "text": "I tried this for as-needed calming (rather than taking daily). First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I\u2019m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems. It may help if you\u2019re too wound up to sleep.",

  "text": "This was the first California Poppy supplement I took.  I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.",

It seemed to work most of the time. Then I decided to try one on a Saturday morning around 10am to see how it helped with anxiety. It didn't seem to have much of an effect,if any. However, that's not to say they won't work for someone else.

  "text": "At first, I thought this product was working well. California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called \u201cglutamate\u201d which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don\u2019t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you\u2019re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I\u2019ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",

  "text": "It\u2019s a Friday night, and I\u2019m staring at a mountain of laundry that seems more like Everest after a long week. Normally, I\u2019d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different\u2014a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I\u2019d heard these were supposed to be nature\u2019s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn\u2019t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity\u2014who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I\u2019d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn\u2019t feel groggy or out of it\u2014just calm, focused, and oddly energized. Even my usual Saturday errands felt less like a chore and more like a leisurely stroll through the day.",

I use a few different products which I rotate every three days, since that seems to keep their effects potent.  I had never tried wild lettuce or California poppy extract before.  I'm happy to say that taking two of these capsules before bedtime has been VERY effective at helping me get to sleep.  I mean they work like a dang charm!  I could almost believe these had THAT kind of poppy in them (they do no actually have that kind of poppy. \ud83d\ude42)  I'm happy to have these on hand, as they have proven so far to be a surefire knockout inducer.

I decided to give these a try and I am super glad I did.  The first time I took these I started to relax and my muscles started to loosen and some of the pain eased up and in turned eased my mind.....these are now a regular supplement, especially while I wait to be scheduled for hip replacement (yeah....ouch).

  "text": "I go this tea because I was recently diagnosed with diverticulitis. I was kind of just looking for something to help relieve the symptoms in conjunction with the other preventative treatments. This tea contains peppermint, which is good to relieve an unhappy stomach. I can say that it does help a little to soothe the irritation and other stuff. But it isn't some kind of miracle elixer. One of the reasons I bought this was because lots of reviews said that it tasted great. That's just not true. I drink lots of teas. Being that my Wife is from China, I keep many different varieties at my house. This tastes far worse than any Ive had. It also leaves a very powerful aftertaste that doesnt go away easily. No big deal, we arent drinking this for pleasure. I just wanted to set the record straight on the flavor issue. The price is also very outrageous. Another reason I thought it either did a great job and might taste really good. It seems to be priced high for no reason at all. I think that after I finish this stuff off, I won't be buying more. It works just ok, taste bad and cost too much.",

  "text": "I decided to give Nelson's Tea Really Root Beer a try, intrigued by the idea of a tea that promised the classic taste of root beer in a loose leaf format. At first sip, the blend of sarsaparilla root and other flavors did remind me of the nostalgic beverage, offering a unique twist on my usual tea routine.The flavor profile is interesting, marrying the earthy notes of herbal tea with the distinct, slightly sweet essence of root beer. It's a novel concept that captures the essence of the soda without the fizz, making it a cozy, caffeine-free alternative for evenings.However, the price tag gave me pause. It's on the higher end for tea, which might make one reconsider its value, especially if you're an avid tea drinker looking for a daily staple. While the novelty and taste are commendable, the cost factor could be a deterrent for those on a budget or for whom tea is a frequent indulgence.In conclusion, Nelson's Tea Really Root Beer is a fun, flavorful experiment for those looking to spice up their tea collection. If the unique flavor combination calls to you and the price isn't a concern, it's worth a try. Otherwise, you might find better value in exploring other teas that offer both satisfaction and a more reasonable price point.",

  "text": "Ladies, if you have horrible period cramps like me then you need to give this tea a try. I found a video on Tik Tok of a girl talking about ways to help period cramps and she mentioned raspberry tea. Honestly, I was skeptical. How is a tea going to help my cramps....A little back story, I decided to take a break from birth control. Doing so brought back my really really really bad cramps. We are talking about gagging, nausea, cramping, bloating, etc. I drink this tea the first few days of my cycle and really alleviated the pain. My most recent period was surprisingly easy to get through - almost no cramping. The taste is not my favorite, but I will easily look past it because of how much it helps me. Will continue to repurchase.",

  "text": "I started drinking hibiscus tea after a friend recommended the Micro Ingredients Organic Hibiscus Flowers, and I\u2019m so glad I did! Not only does it have a refreshing, slightly tart flavor that I love, but I\u2019ve also noticed significant improvements in my overall health and well-being since I began incorporating it into my daily routine.After just a few weeks of drinking this tea, I\u2019ve felt more energized, and my digestion has improved. But what\u2019s truly remarkable is the impact it\u2019s had on my skin\u2014I've noticed a visible increase in skin elasticity and a healthy glow that I hadn\u2019t seen before.The quality of these hibiscus flowers is excellent.

I took two the other day and the feeling was a bit more pronounced, but still not too strong. It did help me fall asleep and I think it helped me stay asleep too, although I did feel a bit groggy when I woke up the next day. Overall I'm pretty satisfied, it's nice to take a little edge off every now and then.",

  "text": "Because I don\u2019t sleep well and have a difficult time relaxing this supplement caught my attention.  It is a 30 day supply (assuming 1 tablet a day but the bottle does say you can take up to 4) for under $10 (at the time of this review). I am never used poppy before so I don\u2019t know exactly how I should use it and wish they provided better direction.  It doesn\u2019t say to use it before bed and doesn\u2019t warn about using it while driving or doing other things that require your attention.  I am taking one in the morning and it is too soon to see if I feel more relaxed during the day or sleep better.  I put a photo against another bottle to show that it comes in a bottle about half the size of other bottles.  I applaud the company for this as too often you get a lot of unnecessary packaging and this company seems to be sensitive to that issue.",

  "text": "I have been drinking this for four days now and Im pretty upset that I still haven\u2019t seen or felt any changes. The tea tastes amazing though that\u2019s the only reason I gave it above a one. But that could be the amount of honey I like with my tea. That being said I feel taken advantage of for a small box of tea bags costing over thirty dollars when I feel like I could get the same thing from a store for about $2.50-$4. I had been a smoker for 14 years and when I got this I had high hopes on clearing out my lungs of all those toxins. Granted I\u2019m only on day four and tbh I will have two cups or more a day. (I really this enjoy tea) but that being said I should feel like my lungs are expanding, I should be coughing up mucus, or I should at least notice SOMETHING! Now I\u2019m going to finish the whole box using one tea bag a day (reusing the tea bag for extra cups) and hope something happens but for now I\u2019m disappointed. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND WASTE TOUR MONEY!!! It\u2019s a placebo effect!",

They actually do make me feel better every time I drink one of their teas. They taste great too and I am so glad that they are organic and don\u2019t add anything artificial, or any sugars, etc. They are all natural herbs of the highest quality. A bonus is the fact that they use unbleached teabags, so no bleach or chemicals are leaching into your tea! I highly recommend you to try their teas because they have so many healthy and delicious flavors. I have 6 different flavors in my pantry right now and I love them all!",

The name of the tea makes it seem great, but also says that it is a detox tea.  May give some folks the wrong impression.A small amount of tea is used when made according to the directions, so not sure of the potency.  The directions are to simmer the tea, rather than to steep it\u2014which is a little unusual.The flavor of the tea is not overwhelming and it is easy to drink.Too early to tell if there are any immediate, short, or long term benefits and/or effects.",

  "text": "I have been drinking Buddha Teas for many years now and have tried quite a few of their different blends. Most importantly, they have all been wonderful!!! They actually do make me feel better every time I drink one of their teas. They taste great too and I am so glad that they are organic and don\u2019t add anything artificial, or any sugars, etc. They are all natural herbs of the highest quality. A bonus is the fact that they use unbleached teabags, so no bleach or chemicals are leaching into your tea! I highly recommend you to try their teas because they have so many healthy and delicious flavors. I have 6 different flavors in my pantry right now and I love them all!",

  "text": "I have found that alternating my bedtime teas helps. This is my latest of 4 that I use, and it immediately became my favorite. The scent is rich and reminds me of Tiramisu. As it's cooling, I sit and breathe it in. The taste is the same and sweet enough, but sometimes I add a teaspoon of local honey.It helps me fall asleep easier. I also alternate several different forms of Melatonin (patch, liposomal, compound and sublingual) and some other natural supplements along with the teas. All in all, they're not perfect, but they make my nights restful, even if I don't sleep like a log straight through. I've done all the recommended things for getting restful sleep, including dark room, sleeping away from electrical outlets, early supper, and I don't drink coffee, tea or use refined sugars or gluten. So yes, I'm trying, and this tea makes it all a little easier. I'm at a stage in my life where I have to accept that my nights of falling into bed, going out like a light and sleeping 8 or 9 hours are past. I've read a few books on insomnia, and it helps to know that our ideal sleep schedule is a modern invention. People used to go to bed when the sun went down, sleep for 3 or 4 hours, get up and putter around, maybe even visit neighbors, then go back to bed and sleep till sunrise. It helps is you don't think of periodic wakefulness as a handicap. On the nights when I simply can't lie in bed, I get up, accompanied by my shih tzu, and pile up on the sofa with my iPad or watch TV for a couple of hours, then go back to bed when I'm sleepy.Thank you, Yogi, for your healthy, soothing teas. I use a lot of them.",

  "text": "So this is a great energizing tea. I have it every morning, and I'm definitely more alert and productive with it. No crash later on in the day. However, if I don't have it, I do get a massive headache. It says 'no headache', but I get the headache w/out it (just no crash the same day). Probably addicted to caffeine, but I didn\u2019t have this problem before with just straight black tea.  And it's really expensive for tea, but I'm so energized and productive with it - I really like it. It's pepperminty-flavor. I had been doing straight black tea for years, but this is definitely better. I try some days to go back to black tea, and it's nice, but doesn't quite have the pick-me-up that this does. I add a little honey to it for sweetness. Yum! The price is a real drawback, but it's quality tea. If you purchase directly on website instead, you can subscribe and purchase more at a time (e.g. 60 bags every 2 months) and it's cheaper. I definitely use my subscription! Still love it. Update: Oh no! They're out of stock! I have tried in vain to find a good replacement (end up mixing mint and black tea...not the same...at all). Soooo sad! This is really the best tea out there. I love it. My favorite morning ritual. Will need to stockpile some when they are back in stock so I never have to run out again! :-)",

  "text": "First off, this product does EXACTLY what it's meant to do - help you fall asleep! I'm not a huge tea fan personally, but after a myriad of pills, supplements, and what felt like everything under the sun to try to fall asleep and stay asleep, I stumbled upon CogniTea. Finally, I was able to get a good nights rest after months!Initially, the scent of the bag itself is nice. It has a good, comforting aroma. However once you let the tea diffuse for around 8 minutes, it's different. The once comforting aroma is pungent and makes you wrinkle your nose. The taste itself is so bad, sour and unappetizing that you'll only be able to take a sip or two at a time, lest you risk an upset stomach. However, please note that I never put anything else in my tea. No sugar, honey, or creamer to help with the taste or smell.Overall, the tea itself helps you fall asleep but it's a doozy to drink, and is nothing short of an unenjoyable nightly battle.",

  "text": "We all know that getting a good night sleep can be a challenging endeavor.  My wife and I wanted to try a few tea options to see how they impacted our ability to fall asleep, stay asleep, and feel refreshed the next morning.  CogniTea\u2019s DeepSleep product was one of the products we decided to try and I\u2019m glad we did!I am a fairly heavy sleeper, but consider myself a night owl at times.  I want to go to bed early, but it just doesn\u2019t happen.  I find that once I try to get back on track with an earlier bedtime, I lay there for what seems to be hours trying to fall asleep.  Recognizing these situations beforehand and having CogniTea\u2019s Deep Sleep product has helped me relax, settle my mind, and ultimately get to sleep sooner.  I\u2019m not an every day tea drinker but this product helps me when I need it most.  I especially like that I can leave the product in the mug and not come back to a bitter drink, regardless of how long I let it steep.My wife on the other hand is an extremely light sleeper.  If I so much as move during the night,  I\u2019m waking her up unfortunately.  I convinced her to try Deep Sleep a week ago and she has been sleeping like a log since.  She\u2019s now drinking it every day, has told me she isn\u2019t waking up to use the restroom in the middle of the night, and says her sleep data is drastically improved.  While I may be a casual user of this product, I think my wife is hooked.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their sleep!",

The tea tastes good but moreimportantly it's effects are very gentle...Drinking it doesn't make me feel dehydrated as the medication did...It seems to settle my stomach as well as keep me from retaining fluid in my legs.  I've tried many different teas and herbs to help with fluid retention and this formula works far better than anything I've tried, including the drugs.  I don't want to take medication and if there is something natural that works better, why not just drink a cup of this every morning....I'm able to re-use my tea bag and have another cup after dinner...Just perfect!

  "text": "I purchased this tea for myself. I have had a hard time getting tired ,falling asleep, and staying asleep. I decided to look around for a natural tea without sugar to help me relax for I can actually get some good sleep , so when I saw this one I decided to try it and see if it does what it is supposed to do ..  The tea does indeed calm you down enough so that you are able to get groggy but not necessarily fall asleep. I like to drink this tea as well as take my  Alteril before going to sleep . I will usually drink the tea an hour before I take my meds , then I will attempt to go to sleep . You don\u2019t get a lot of tea bags to be honest but if you use them wisely they are worth the price and the tea doesn\u2019t taste bad either . If you have any stomach acid problems like me make sure to drink a lot of water with this tea because it has a tendency to mess with the stomach well maybe it\u2019s just me . I do have a sensitive stomach but nevertheless I wanted to give a heads up just Incase .",

Best purchase ever!!!Before I made this purchase, I was drinking 4 different kind of teas to help me sleep and I was taking melatonin as well and they did help, but they did not help as amazing as this tea does.I drink this tea with some fresh lime or lemon juice, it taste great and the effects are quick too. For me, within 10 minutes, I start feeling super relax and I start to feel tire and sleepy. By the hour of drinking this tea, I'm already knocked out and sleeping like a baby.With this tea, I have been sleeping anywhere between 6 - 9 hours a day and I love it! I don't wake up groggy or sleepy, I woke up refresh and ready for my day.I love this tea and plan on buying them and I've already recommended it to many of my friends and families.",

Not anymore!!!  It worked for him, too.  Gifted him a box bc of this deal... In the spirit of pay it forward, and bc I want my friend to get solid rest.  It is so important for us all.Anyway, I used to take melatonin.  Even with that, I'd wake up and stay up at times, then be groggy in the morning (only if I didn't get a full night of sleep).Anyway, I enjoy and appreciate drinking the tea instead of taking a pill.  It's a new evening ritual.Very important to let the tea steep for the 15 minutes as started in the directions.  Mild taste.Buy the tea and enjoy your rest. \ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udf75",

  "text": "These were a gift for a very dear friend who has cancer.  I had previously given her a goodie box & included 1 box of the Nighty Night Tea.  A few weeks ago she told how much she liked it & she had used up that box.  I know that she has difficulty sleeping at times, so I looked at what you had available & I liked this bundle.  I ordered it for her & had it delivered to her.  She was so thrilled.  She told me how relaxing this tea is & how much she enjoys it.  I felt really good knowing I had given her something she really enjoys & that helps her get a good nights sleep.  I highly recommend this tea.  This is one of my favorite teas that I\u2019ve enjoyed for about 5 years.  Traditional Medicinals makes fabulous teas, they\u2019re so smooth, so flavorful & helps me relax.  I highly recommend this flavor because of it\u2019s relaxing & calming effect at bedtime.",

  "text": "This tea is great!  I have been under a lot of stress lately, and this tea has definitely helped me get to sleep.  I have been drinking it for about a month now as needed.  I feel like I sleep a bit more deeply when I drink this, which I have attributed to being more relaxed at bedtime.  It is not a miracle, but I think that the tea itself along with the routine of having it before bed really helps me to relax.Make sure you steep it as directed for 10-15minutes.  I have noticed that if I do not cover my cup to keep the heat in the tea does not come out as strong.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because the flavor is not my favorite.  Its nice for sure, but a bit mild for me.  It is a better and more complex flavor than any other nighttime relaxation tea I have tried.  I prefer to either make a strong cup or sometimes I steep it with a bag of chamomile tea as well which makes a very nice flavor.  I typically have one cup an hour before bed and another while I sit in bed and read right before I go to sleep.  After the first cup I feel more calm, after the second cup I feel drowsy and ready for sleep! I bought the case of six because I have enjoyed this product so much!",

I was excited to add this one into the mix. It's not bad... I'd say the flavor is less pronounced than some of my others, but it's okay. I usually use tea bags, so it's fun to try a loose leaf and compare. I did notice that some of the smaller pieces came out on the two different style tea holders I used. I'm not sure if this normal with loose leaf, but I don't care for sipping on those. As for a calming effect, it is probably comparable to the others I drink. It's a nice tea. I do think the price is a little steep (no pun intended) if you haven't already tried the tea to know you like it. It is a big bag though, so it'll last a while.",

So far so good. the taste isn't bad, it is very flowery though, so if you're not into that it likely won't be the tea for you. We've had some restful sleep after taking it, and we look forward to using it in the near future as needed.",

It only is calm and relaxing, IMHO, if it becomes part of a routine/ritual where you can otherwise take some time and enjoy the taste and aroma experience in the right mindset. In that case, it's more about the other things than the tea, but this certainly fits the bill. There may be less expensive options, but this is a good one.",

  "text": "This is a nighttime tea with chamomile, lavender, linden blossom, valerian root, lemon balm, passion flower, and rose petals in it. As you can imagine, it has a floral scent/taste, which is very relaxing and soothing but might not be to everyone's taste. It is caffeine-free. It suggests on the back to use it with a filter bag, but I used it in a regular tea strainer with no issues. The leaves are large enough that I didn't get sediment in my tea.It is quite expensive but a large bag, considering you only need one heaped teaspoon for 8oz of water. There are an estimated 33 cups in the bag, so it is slightly less than a dollar a cup, but that's still more expensive than some other teas I've tried that come in at less than fifty cents per cup.The scent is quite strong and looks quite pretty, so if you don't want to drink this as tea, you could use it for potpourri. I liked it as tea but I think the lavender could be toned back slightly.",

Now, I shower, follow my skincare routine, have a cup of tea, and head to bed. I also use mood lighting and play relaxing music. After finishing the tea and lying down I fell asleep within 15 minutes. It also has a very pleasant taste. I\u2019m happy with this product and going to order more.",

  "text": "This is a new brand for me, and I couldn't be happier. The price is better than my usual brands, and you can buy small packets to try the flavor. I buy loose leaf tea, and always make ice tea, using the cold brew method. (put filter and water in pitcher, leave on counter for a couple hours, then refrigerate for 8-12 hours, or when it seems done) As you can see in the pictures, I have 2 pitchers going at once. The other pitcher has another tea from this manufacturer.This tea has a strong ginger taste, which probably is why it comes first in the name, lol! I'm used to ones that are peach first, then ginger, which isn't as strong. It's okay with me, but I'm glad I didn't add some fresh ginger pieces to it when it was brewing! I like to add frozen fruit to my tea when drinking it, to keep it cold, and add a little flavor.The first picture is of the dry tea before it is brewed, straight out of the packet. You can see big chunks of fruit in there, with other spices and tea. The aroma is magical.The second picture is the tea after it's been brewed. You can see the chunks have all expanded, letting out all of their goodness.  I haven't seen many other brands that have similar qualities. The third picture is of my two pitchers, both filled with Tiesta Tea, one being the Ginger Sweet Peach, the one on the right.Yes, I highly recommend this product.",

  "text": "Costco used to sell this tea as an immunity tea.  My mom is obsessed with it and drinks it religiously anytime she feels under the weather or in general during flu season.  Given the ingredients list, it is probably a good source of vitamin C and antioxidants.  It is a loose leaf tea that definitely benefits from having a fine-mesh tea strainer.  It is also really strong and quite tart, but then again so is rose hip tea.  I like that it is non-caffeinated and in bulk, so you can decide how much you want to brew.

  "description": "The California poppy is the state flower of California, a tender perennial plant bearing blue-green leaves and 2 to 4 inch (5 to 10 cm) wide flowers that open in bright sun and close on cloudy days and at night. The California poppy is considered an ancient plant whose origins are not entirely known. Native Americans in California prized them as a source of food and for the oil that could be extracted from the plant. Eschscholzia californica was the first named member of the genus Eschscholzia, which was named by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso after the Baltic German botanist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, his friend and colleague on Otto von Kotzebue\u2019s scientific expedition to California and the greater Pacific in mid-1810s aboard the Russian ship Rurik.",

It\u2019s part of my overall ritual of sleep hygiene including sleep music, a hot bath/shower and reading. It is a little pricey but well worth it in my opinion.

  "text": "I am a huge fan of Rishi. They source THE BEST from around the world. This chamomile brews THE MOST AMAZING and satisfying elixir. I noticed the Egyptian source was replaced with another region but the quality remains superb. Unfortunately, Amazon does not understand the care required to protect the dried whole flowers during delivery and they put it in a plastic sleeve without even the slightest cushion. The result was a badly crushed product. Rishi packs their direct orders properly so Amazon needs to catch up in this area Most people wouldn't care but if I wanted dust, I would have ordered it. I ordered whole flowers and now I have to put them in paper filters to prevent the crushed bits from ending up in my cup...I don't like the taste of paper, I'm spoiled, I know. I tried my microperforated filter but it wasn't enough. But it doesn't stop me from enjoying this Superior product. I just might order direct next time if Amazon can't correct their poor handling. I will say in Amazon's defense they made it right when I complained about my product showing up the way it did. Amazon always makes it right for me. You can't lose on Rishi either way.",

  "text": "I wanted to try loose leaf tea and bought this flavor to replace the prepackaged Honey Vanilla Chamomile I usually buy. But this is even better! Open opening the package, immediately you can smell the freshness of the leaves. As this was my first time using loose leaf tea, it was fun just gently inhaling the scent, taking a moment to identify and appreciate each of the ingredients.Usually I can't wait for the bags to steep but this time I gave the leaves the appropriate amount of time, the recommended 4 minutes, excited to experience each flavor. While my cup usually has a generous helping of sugar and milk, this time I only added a splash to cool it down, and a small teaspoon. It did not disappoint. The flavors came together beautifully, without the usual bitterness that requires all the sugar to make it enjoyable for me. This time, I actually enjoyed the flavor of the tea itself, savoring each sip.Not only was the sup itself wonderful, but the packaging is aesthetically pleasing. Tightly pressed so no air gets inside keeping leaves fresh.The seller also included a complimentary sample of another flavor. I anticipate getting at least 3 or 4 cups from the sample alone!I highly recommend this tea, this seller, and will definitely be purchasing again.Thank you so much!EDIT- Even though the bag doesnt look like much at first, it goes a long way!We've had this bag for 2 weeks now, and had probably 10 cups worth.  We haven't even gone through a quarter of it. We used to have to use two bags of the pre bagged tea for each cup, so even though there were 20 bags, we would only get 10 cups out of it, and it's about $5 at our local store. This loose leaf not only taste so much better but it you end up getting more bang for your buck!",

  "text": "This is my second review;  I fixed a cup up and let it steep for ten minutes. I drank it at 10:00 PM.  It totally destresses/slows down your brain, relaxes your muscles and you fall asleep faster.  But getting up in the morning can be a challenge.  I had to take two naps the next day.  I'm in the over 65 age group and just had surgery so I am in recovery phase, but this was crazy.  I was actually wobbly on my feet!  I was groggy till 3:45 PM.  The next time I used it I REMOVED the tea bag after 3 minutes.  I was more alert the next morning.  You do have to pay attention to just how strong you want this tea.  Don't underestimate its power to work!  My daughter was sleepy to 3:30 the next day and her best friend said it knocked her out and she slept like a rock until nearly noon the next day. Here's the list of ingredients:Yogi Soothing Caramel Bedtime tea contains the following ingredients: Organic Chamomile Flower, Organic Rooibos Leaf**, Organic Roasted Chicory Root, Organic Skullcap Leaf, Organic Nutmeg Kernel, Organic Caramel Flavor, Organic Vanilla Flavor, Organic Cinnamon Bark, Organic Stevia Leaf, Organic Cardamom Pod, Organic California Poppy Plant, Organic Ginger Root, Organic Clove Bud, L-Theanine Suntheanine, Organic Black Pepper, Organic Cinnamon Bark Oil, Organic Cardamom Seed Oil, Organic Ginger Root Oil.",

  "text": "Somewhere I read that thyme tea might be beneficial for congestion and coughing spells.  I am asthmatic and get bouts of bronchial coughing spells that can be a nuisance and hard to control at times. My asthma is caused by inflammation to the airways and thyme is touted as possibly being beneficial for inflammation and soothing a throat irritated by coughing. So, hey, anything that might help I'll at least give it a try.  It does have a pleasant herbal taste, at least in my opinion, and is soothing on my throat. Since it is an herbal tea I can drink it anytime of day or even in the evening and not have to worry about caffeine disturbing my sleep. I can usually get two cups of tea from one teabag so for my personal use it lasts me awhile. I purchased this thyme tea online because I could not find it in any of my local stores. I would purchase it again as it would be good for allergy season as well when I get the sneezing and coughing spells from allergen irritants. Plus it just makes a nice warm soothing nightcap too.I have low blood pressure and am not on medication so I don't worry too much about  the thyme tea raising my blood pressure but those on blood pressure medication might want to take caution. Always, check with your doctor first when in doubt even about herbal products as sometimes they can interfere with prescription meds.",

  "text": "This tea worked miracles for me.  I am not exaggerating one bit.I'm 71 years old with lots of allergies - to foods and environmental vegetation.In July there was a huge wildfire in the mountains near us.  I felt like I was hit with a ton of bricks.  The wildfire smoke wreaked havoc on my body.  My face swelled up badly.  I had difficulty breathing.  My blood pressure went up 21 points and stayed that way for 6 weeks.  I went to my primary care doctor and urgent care during this time.  I was a mess.Then I learned that the fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke settles in the lungs, gets into the bloodstream and can cross the blood-brain barrier.  I was on high doses of prednisone for 6 weeks.  I didn't get better.I finally learned that thyme tea is an anti-inflammatory. So, I bought some from Amazon.  I flavored it with cinnamon, ginger, a pinch of cloves and a little honey.  It tasted good.  After just half a cup, I started to feel better - finally.  After an hour, I was starting to feel 'healthy'.Now, after 3 days, my neighbors and friends are telling me that the swelling on my face is getting better.  When it's so noticeable that even casual neighbors are noticing the difference, you know something good is happening.  And, I just checked my blood pressure.  It's down by 15 points.This tea is really healing me.  And, a friend who is a chef dropped by and I asked him to taste the tea.  After 3 sips, he said that the tightness he had in his chest went away.  I wasn't even aware that he was having chest problems.  He said he hasn't been bothered by asthma in a long time, but that day his chest felt tight.  The tea helped him to feel better.These are true stories.  Take it for what you will.  I just know that I'm happy with the effects this tea has had on my health.",

  "text": "I love the choice of ingredients and the fact that it\u2019s certified organic too. It\u2019s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it\u2019s hard for me to get a \u201cfull\u201d dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there\u2019s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don\u2019t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally \u2014 the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don\u2019t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I\u2019d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I\u2019ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it\u2019s such a strange combination of flavors I\u2019m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.  In a pinch I would use this but I think I\u2019d prefer a pill or just a simple elderberry gummy instead.  Just my preference anyway.  Otherwise the product itself is clean and seems to be an excellent way to boost your immune system when necessary.",

  "text": "This item is a 30ml amber bottle of organic herb tincture that is plant based and formulated to provide immunity support. The bottle includes an eye dropper cap that is used to deliver the recommended 2 dropper full of the liquid. The ingredients includes extracts of echinacea, elderberry, thyme, sage, yarrow, and lemon balm in a proprietary combination. The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity. The liquid tastes quite bad so I recommend adding the 2 dropper full to some juice. I appreciate that it's made in the USA. I find the price point for 20 days supply to be rather steep. Overall, it's not a bad tincture to add to your daily supplement regiment, but it's not something I will continue to use given I have other more cost effective immunity support supplements.",
