  "style": "Standard Packaging",
  "description": "Our delicious GaiaKids Black Elderberry Syrup is suitable for everyday use for the whole family. This popular formula is USDA Certified Organic and made with only organic black elderberries. Ideal for both daily and seasonal immune support, our Black Elderberry Syrup is a delicious and potent way to maintain your child's immune health all year long.\n Elderberries have been traditionally used for functions of the gastrointestinal tract, supporting a healthy body temperature and perspiration during an acute immune challenge, and for supporting the resilience of the body throughout the difficult winter months. Both elderflower and elderberry are rich in polyphenols, which have antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress is often produced during an immune response, and having sufficient antioxidant storage in the body may help to maintain the health and integrity of tissues. \n From seed to shelf, Gaia is deeply committed to the purity, integrity, and potency of each product. Since Gaia Herbs was just a seedling in 1987, we have focused on connecting people, plants, and the planet to create healing. We use only organic methods to cultivate more than 6.5 million plants each year. That same organic approach continues throughout our manufacturing. We use patented technology to achieve the highest efficacy of each herb.\n We are a company devoted to transparency. We have created a Gaia\u2019s MeetYourHerbs platform, one of the world\u2019s first and only herb traceability programs, allowing consumers to learn about and engage with their organic herbs. We are able to source premium ingredients so you always know what's in your supplement. \n As a Certified B Corporation, we are actively working toward building a more inclusive and sustainable world. We nurture healthy connections between plants and people by encouraging strong relationships and championing environmental sustainability within the communities that we work with around the world.",
