Not 100%, but it does make a big difference.  Much, much better than other supplements I have tried e.g. black cohosh, chasteberry, dong quai, sage, soy, bioidentical progsterone. These other supplements have absolutely no positive effect. I checked with my naturopath, and she says that this Pacific Herbs formula works very well for some women. On the other hand, black cohosh, chasteberry, etc. work incredibly well for other women. You have to experiment to see which one works for you.This price is relatively high, I've seen it for between 40-55 dollars here on amazon.  I try to buy multiple bags when the price goes down. You have to order quickly since the price can easily go back up an hour afterward.I find this does not taste great as a tea, so I use the scoop to pour a dry dose in my mouth and then swallow with water. I don't mind the taste at all when the product is not in tea form, it has an herbal licorice flavor.-----------------Update: I was still taking this,, but I am so tired of paying 60 dollars a month ($720 per year). This is just too much to keep paying. I have recently started doing a castor oil pack every night and that takes away my hot flashes.

Still, nothing has helped the extreme pain I've had to experience since I began menstruating some 30 years ago. Acupuncture took the edge off and I do recommend it, but the pain was still there. Motrin helped a little too, but made me experience abdominal pain (even though I only took one every 12 hours). And I really am not a fan of Western Medicine, except for emergency/trauma stuff. I have very short periods only lasting two days, but so much pain. Anyway, long story short. I was in my local health food store and asked (yet again) if they could recommend anything for SEVERE menstrual pain. They showed me this, and I bought. This is now my second cycle using this product, and my pain (normally a 10 plus) is about a 2, occasionally goes to a 4, but still manageable (without having to put crap [Motrin] in my body).

Also, in many foraging guides you can’t tell anything about who the plant is based on the images. This book is my dream, visually.

It starts out with a bit of pertinent information about foraging safety and best practices, and mixes in some of the author’s personal spiritual relationship with the plants. I have to admit I wasn’t expecting there to be a spiritual element to this book, but it doesn’t negatively impact the ability to use this book as a reference. This book also describes the various ways you can prepare your foraged medicinal plants for use. This section is particularly informative.After all of the pertinent foraging information is imparted, the book gets straight to the 120 wild plants, which are listed alphabetically. Each plant gets a breakdown including its common name, its scientific name, any other names it might be called, and what the plant is used for. Each plant also gets at least one picture. You learn how to identify your plant. You learn where/when/how to harvest it. You’re taught what each plant is used for, how to ensure a future harvest, and you even get a breakdown of how best to prepare your plant for its medicinal purposes. Do you use your cottonwood buds for a tincture? Do you use them for a salve? This book will tell you.The back of the book features a handy metric conversion chart, a list of references, and a helpful index that allows you to look up individual plants by name or by the ailment you’re hoping to relieve.It’s a data-packed book laid out in a fairly straightforward and thoughtful manner. Those curious about herbalism, foraging, or just native plants in the Pacific Northwest would really enjoy this. And for those not interested in the spiritual aspects discussed in this book, don’t worry. The author’s spirituality does not permeate the book in a way that negatively impacts its usefulness for plant reference.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dwK3WUMYL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HbcDZ9m4L.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ztMtX1DJL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fam3qbKxL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GYFQruuxL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zQCMD7m8L.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510a4YvOI7L.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PoZudOZxL.jpg

Beginning this journey of learning can be overwhelming without solid resources. This self-published introductory guide to wildcrafting, herbalism, and medicinal plants of the Pacific Northwest is one of the more recent books to become available.The author endeavors to cover a broad foundation of concepts for those beginning to learn, including ethical harvesting, plant identification (including poisonous species), basic plant uses in herbalism, an overview of the history of herbalism and plant medicine, and highlighting a basic inventory of common plants that can be found in the Pacific Northwest. It should be noted that a number of the plants showcased in this book can also be found widely throughout North America.As a reviewer, my opinion is that this book is a good starting point for those who are unfamiliar with herbalism and field botany, however for gaining requisite skills and knowledge there is no substitute for spending time out in the field with an experienced botanist and/or herbalist. Learning plant identification is a life-long art, as is developing deep relationships with individual medicinal plants. This book would be a starting point for someone seeking to begin their plant journey.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OY52fJI2L.jpg

Not a great PNW plant resource.,3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2022",True,"This book does a good job of detailing how and when to ethically harvest medicinal plants, and how to preserve and prepare them. It also describes 47 medicinal plants found in the PNW. Line drawings and written descriptions are provided for each species, as well as some basic botany to help in plant identification. Strangely the drawing for Thimbleberry appears to be a drawing of Trailing Blackberry, having the compound leaves with three leaflets of this related species rather than the simple five-lobed leaves of Thimbleberry. Overall the drawings do roughly emulate their subjects though. As a botanist I would be wary of beginners using these resources alone to identify plants for medicinal use, but in combination with a good field guide or two the resources provided would be useful.In terms of readability I found Boyle's prose to be a bit awkward at times. There doesn't appear to be an editor for the book, which does it a disservice. Nonetheless, the author's knowledge of and passion for herbology and wildcrafting make this book informative and engaging. I particularly appreciate his emphasis on ethical harvesting, and the gratitude and joy to be had from engaging directly with wild plants.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OY52fJI2L.jpg

The author repeated safety warnings many times - which is good, considering how easy it can be to have a reaction to a plant or accidentally find a poisonous look-alike. There were times I found the writing a bit confusing or odd, but it didn't effect my overall reading enjoyment. The line drawings were interesting,  but I agree with another reviewer that having another resource to verify plants against would be a good thing,  because personally, I would rather have a color photo to compare the plant to than just a line drawing - it would help me feel more confident in my identification. Also, this book isn't about PNW native plants,  although it does mention some of them,  it is about medicinal plants (some of which are considered invasive in Washington state - like Herb Robert) that grow in the PNW, and I have to admit I was hoping there would be info on more of the truly native plants.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OY52fJI2L.jpg

For example, dandelion is so hearty you can feel free to harvest as much as you want, while endangered plants are off limits.

After watching a few YouTube videos, I decided to make a gel to be used in smoothies. Based on the color of this moss, it seems to be good quality. A very little (like 1/5th of this bag) makes a whole blender full of gel. You have to wash this very thoroughly. There was not much sand in it but there were some other type of algae attached to it (in tiny amounts, but needed to be cleaned). It is easier to clean them after soaking the moss for a while. So, I washed it and then put in water with some lemon juice for about 4-5 hours (unlike 12 hours to overnight as recommended on the listing). Though it has tones of yellow and red in dry form, most of it is gone after the wash and it turns into a pinkish white noodle-like form. There were some thick and hard parts and some soft parts. The latter more quickly softens and the hard pieces become like soft leather, but this doesn’t seem to matter. After putting the whole thing with some soak water in the blender, I got a pretty smooth and thick juice. I took a spoonful and I had no difficulty swallowing it. The gel has no smell or flavor to it. So, consider this as a neutral ingredient in whatever you are planning to make.

Whether you have a lot of land or just a windowsill, with this book, you can help your own health and let's be honest, given the rising cost of modern pharmaceuticals, your wallet as well.  Ms. Rempel does include the reminder to check with your doctor before beginning this medicinal pursuit to help ensure your safety.  Various links are included to help expand your knowledge beyond the borders of this book. Modern medicine is still in its infancy compared to older established cultural practices such as Western Use, Ayurveda Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine and all three of the established practices have used herbs in the treatment of others for thousands of years and therefore, the benefits of the herbs should not be overlooked and if you're still doubting that, consider the fact that even the Father of Medicine himself, Hippocrates used these herbs and had listed 400 herbs for their medicinal properties in 5th century BC.Many of the herbs listed are ones that most people should be familiar with: Aloe Vera, Chamomile, Chili Pepper, Elderberry, Garlic, Ginger, Ginkgo, Lavender, Mint, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Sage, St. John's Wort, Thyme and Turmeric. The others are Ashwagandha, Calendula, Echinacea, Hawthorn, Holy Basil, Hyssop, Milk Thistle, Moringa, and Valerian. Covered subjects with each of these herbs is planting, the needs of the individual herb, how to harvest it, the best way to store them and what you can do with each herb after it's been harvested plus potential side effects, correct dosage, the traditional and modern benefits, possible interactions with other medicines, and who shouldn't use it as an herbal medicine.The one section that stood out to me not just because it's always a good idea to have alternatives to how you take any medicine, be it traditional or modern, but because after reading through it, I ended up making a lot of these or at least those that I had the ingredients for was titled: “Putting those homestead herbs to good use with 16 simple recipes”. These recipes range from curry to whiskey and while not quite everything in between, you'll be hard pressed not to find at least one that you'll want to devour out of these mouthwatering recipes.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Vzwi+mH8L.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718lg4PxBxL.jpg

Or anyone else on their homesteading journey.,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2022",True,"I received the advanced copy link for the PDF version of this book about 2-3 weeks ago. I am an herbalism student, so I thought it would be helpful to tack this on for learning. It was quite helpful, as I did not inherit the gardening skills of my parents & grandparents. There are some nice tips in this book that I think will help out when I start to construct my pollinator, herbal/plant medicine, & vegetable garden out back. I've been actively trying to become a better DIY person for years. Just this year I dove in & started learning more with some local & online folks to forage, wildcraft, & homestead. This advanced copy was a great addition to my list of resources. There are some things I knew beforehand, as I've really only DIY'd with essential oils. Some recipes are very similar to what I've been doing for years. There are things I didn't know or hear about before. I'm hoping I can order a physical book, as the PDF version was a little hard to read with my eye issues. Sending it to my kindle finally worked. But the best viewing for this advanced PDF copy was the kindle app on my tablet. I've found out that PDFs show up differently & one doesn't have all the highlighting & note-taking capabilities compared to a digital book. I'm still one of those that cling to physical books, especially those for reference. This will be added to my physical library when I can afford it. I have enjoyed Jenni's emails & other sources of information since being introduced to her & her knowledge a few weeks ago. I'd definitely recommend it to a beginner. It appears to be laid out understandably. At least for me, who processes things a bit differently & might need a different way of learning than some other folks. I wouldn't call myself a beginner. Maybe more middle-of-the-road for some aspects, maybe an expert in others.

To be honest, I only use pepper on my mashed potatoes and crushed red peppers on my pizza. Beyond that, I have never used anything else. Jenni Rempel, the author, does an excellent job of making the book easily digestible. It doesn't feel like you are reading a book at all. Instead, it feels like you are sitting down at a table, drinking coffee and talking about herbs and the benefits they can do for you, and how easy it can be to set up something to maximize the growth of these herbs. The book's format is easy to understand and comprehend from the front to the back, which optimizes the reading experience. It is a handbook. It'll serve beginners well and perhaps even keep seasoned pros on their toes. This book is very informational.Aside from the information, what this book does well, in the beginning, is it'll make you think. At the beginning of the book, the author dives into a few mysteries and the history of herbs. She attempts to answer the question 'can science and nature work together?', while ""herbs have an incredible history but lack the volume of scientific studies to prove their benefits. Pharmaceuticals are still in their infancy compared with traditional medicine"" (pg 19 of 166). I admire the attempt to wrestle with the question and give the best answer that can be given, the answer is both, and they need to work together in unity.

I was fascinated by the aloe vera chapter and will probably start growing my own in a windowsill. As it turns out, natural aloe vera is not green!! It is something companies add to their product in an effort to make it look more how we think natural aloe vera would look like.I love the homesteader approach to life. It is this rough enthusiasm for trying your best that appeals to me. I do backyard gardening and did not realize how much more I expand with different herbs that I had overlooked. Jenni really is through throughout her book on tips to help the plants live, what to expect along the way, what they can used for with natural or herbal medicine and what the science says on each.

My first review on amazon ever,5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2022",True,"So its my first ever review on amazon. I am not a fan of writing reviews but i just need to tell you guys about this tea. As u can see on the pic - this is what i received! I paid for a medium size tea for sleep . And they sent me a cute letter with my name saying that they multiplied my tea in size and also gifted me a small bag of peppermint tea on top of that. Also they included couple of beautiful post cards. I felt so appreciated as a customer! Not saying that the tea itself smells as a fresh fields of mountain area… it made me sleep as a baby in just 5 mins! I am struggling with a severe anxiety and ptsd. So when i am saying “sleep like a baby”- it means a world to me. I was having serious issues with my sleep ,nightmares and insomnia… and this herbs made me have a wonderful restful night! My husband also took a cup of this blend and was sleeping amazing as well. It tastes very very pleasant!So if u struggle with a healthy sleep or anxiety or any hard period of life when your nerves need a support - try this.Again- i am amazed !!

But it doesn't. I have to use a rubber band around it to try to keep it closed. It's odd that something like herbal tea leaves would not come in a closable container.Other than the inconvenience of that, this big ol' bag of organic peppermint leaves smells pretty amazing and tastes great. As soon as you open the bag, the strong minty, menthol aroma fills your nasal passageways and actually helps to clear them.It's potent, and the taste is surprisingly refreshing. At least it was surprising to me... I'm not used to drinking minty teas, and this one makes a delicious, bold tea with a slight tinge of sweetness and grassiness. You can smell that in there. It's more complex in aroma than one miggt expect.I like to mix it with organic raspberry leaves, organic elderberries & organic calendula flowers. But it really adds a perfect touch to herbal teas that are lacking in that little something, lacking in taste, in that pizzazz.Peppermint tea gives you a very cool and refreshing feeling, making it perfect for summer get-togethers, it gives you energy, and helps ease feelings of nausea. It's also known to give you mental alertness and clarity. This stuff is pretty powerful but not overwhelming in any way.If infused, the peppermint extract can be applied to sore muscles for some relief. You can blend with Arnica montana, Comfrey & Calendula as well, which are great for conditioning skin, healing bruises, and relieving soreness, stiffness and pain.I'm pleasantly pleased with this large bag of organic peppermint leaves, and I have so many plans for it!

Although they have a strong scent in the bag, the had almost no flavor, and definitely no flavor that I could identify as mint. The Davidson's spearmint was so powdery that it leaked out of the tea ball. This Frontier Co-Op bulk peppermint tea is an improvement on both fronts. First, the leaves are cut to the right size and don't leak out of the tea ball. Second, it has a strong minty smell and actually tastes like peppermint. I don't use any type of sweetener, which limits the taste. That's why I only give it 4 stars overall. With some sugar, it should be a great tea.

But every other herb-related topic is embellished and elaborated on. There are dozens of pages with full-color, labeled illustrations of different ""theme"" gardens you can plan. Whole chapters EACH on potpurri, herbal cosmetics, dyes, medicines, and household cleaners. Fabulous, unique homemade gift items like herbal-scented beads--that's right, painted beads made entirely out of herbs and plants!The food/cooking section alone is worth the price of the book.

Each page or set of pages (depending on how much information) covers an herb or plant or flower, and it goes over myth and folklore of the plant, name meanings and origins, and varieties of the plant, as well as a sidebar that has the cultivation information (soil, sun exposure, growing tips and guides, harvesting and preserving) as well as possible uses (decorative, culinary, household, aromatic, medicinal, and cosmetic).On top of this, there's sections where the author goes in depth for planning an herb garden, basic all purpose small and large herb garden layouts and plants contained, patio, balcony, and indoor herb gardens, theme and aromatic gardens, the list goes on, with another ten or more.  Also included are smaller herb guides (herbs for flowers and foliage, salad herbs, herbal trees, etc), a guide to herbal decorations such as wreaths and hangings, garlands, herbal baskets and the like, herbs within the kitchen (soups, fish, meat, etc - just about anything you'd like to cook), herbs for the household (household products, dyes, papers, toys and trinkets, potpourri, etc), herbs for beauty, essential oils, herbs for health, cultivating and harvesting herbs...

It makes it a bit of a pain to start, but the index does have an accurate guide (though it's in scientific names, not common ones).

I haven't tried all of the recipes, so I cannot say for certain that they are all fabulous, but there is definitely plenty of information.This book has a 1988 copyright, and it does give off a little bit of an 80's vibe, but herbs haven't changed much in the last few decades, and the majority of the information is still useful.

Worldwide research is continuously being done and brown seaweed has been found to be the most beneficial type. This product, MODIFILAN, is the purest, most natural nutritional supplement made from the brown seaweed Laminaria Japonica. Extract contains the life essential properties of Organic Iodine, Alginates, Fucoidan and Laminarin. Worldwide scientific studies and clinical research of these elements showed: *Organic Iodine feeds the Thyroid Gland, which controls metabolism and promotes maturation of the nervous system. Iodine is important for thyroid disorders, wherever underactive or overactive. *Alginate is a natural absorbent of radioactive elements, heavy metals and free radicals. It has the unique ability of binding heavy metals and radioactive elements to its own molecules. As the Alginate cannot be broken down by the bile or saliva and cannot be absorbed by the body, it is secreted from the body together with the heavy metals and radioactive substances. *Fucoidan causes certain types of rapidly growing cells to self-destruct. Promoting apoptosis, Fucoidan helps to naturally eliminate harmful cells from organism. *Laminarin is a polysaccharide helpful in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It exhibits 30% of the anticoagulant activity of heparin. These elements, treasured in brown seaweeds, are enhanced by patented cold-temperature extraction technology, which does not break their molecular structure. And MODIFILAN is not just another dry seaweed product - it is highly concentrated product.

I also found that it is hard to get ""pure"" seaweed because much of it is contaminated in the ocean. I trusted this product's web site for the safety of this product and bought the Modifilan.

After only several months of taking this daily along with these other products, which I will list below, the cancer disappeared. It was a truly miracle to all of us and the doctors could not explain it, but I believe that these products greatly helped along with a change in diet (eliminate sugar and eat veggies). The other products that were taken in combination with this were, listed from most important to least taken were: Essiac, IP-6, Source Naturals Immune Defense (mushrooms), liquid chlorophyll, Krill oil,  Purple Defense, Momordica extract, Curcumin.

I was treated for Lyme disease late 2013 in Scottsdale.  Prior to going to AZ for treatment I had all of my mercury fillings removed and teeth fixed by an awesome dentist. I tested off the charts for both lead and mercury.  While undergoing IV treatment it included some chelation to lower my heavy metals.  By the end of my treatment I was tested again and they were lowered, but still higher than one wants. My Lyme doctor told me when I returned home to Texas I would need to continue chelation therapy. I bought an IV package, but it took 3 months before the home doctor re-tested me for heavy metals before we began chelation therapy.  During those 3 months I took 5-7 Modifilan daily just to help with my energy and I was low on iodine. Shockingly, when my chelation test came back after the 3 months of taking Modifilan my lead and mercury and other heavy metal levels were so low we did not have to do a single chelation treatment!!!  The 3 months of brown seaweed had pulled it out. I had read that it would, but did not know that it would do so efficiently! I always took it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a big glass of water due to the iodine. Side benefit it helped my BM's to be smoother and easier to pass.Update: June 8, 2018  I am still taking the Modifilian. When I run out I definitely  notice. Still love it. It still helps with my energy and I am assuming that it is still removing mercury. As your body detoxes heavy metals little by little more will dump from the cells.

Extract contains the life essential properties of Organic Iodine, Alginates, Fucoidan and Laminarin. Worldwide scientific studies and clinical research of these elements showed: *Organic Iodine feeds the Thyroid Gland, which controls metabolism and promotes maturation of the nervous system. Iodine is important for thyroid disorders, wherever underactive or overactive. *Alginate is a natural absorbent of radioactive elements, heavy metals and free radicals. It has the unique ability of binding heavy metals and radioactive elements to its own molecules. As the Alginate cannot be broken down by the bile or saliva and cannot be absorbed by the body, it is secreted from the body together with the heavy metals and radioactive substances. *Fucoidan causes certain types of rapidly growing cells to self-destruct. Promoting apoptosis, Fucoidan helps to naturally eliminate harmful cells from organism. *Laminarin is a polysaccharide helpful in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It exhibits 30% of the anticoagulant activity of heparin. These elements, treasured in brown seaweeds, are enhanced by patented cold-temperature extraction technology, which does not break their molecular structure.

After only several months of taking this daily along with these other products, which I will list below, the cancer disappeared.

I was treated for Lyme disease late 2013 in Scottsdale.  Prior to going to AZ for treatment I had all of my mercury fillings removed and teeth fixed by an awesome dentist. I tested off the charts for both lead and mercury.  While undergoing IV treatment it included some chelation to lower my heavy metals.  By the end of my treatment I was tested again and they were lowered, but still higher than one wants. My Lyme doctor told me when I returned home to Texas I would need to continue chelation therapy. I bought an IV package, but it took 3 months before the home doctor re-tested me for heavy metals before we began chelation therapy.  During those 3 months I took 5-7 Modifilan daily just to help with my energy and I was low on iodine. Shockingly, when my chelation test came back after the 3 months of taking Modifilan my lead and mercury and other heavy metal levels were so low we did not have to do a single chelation treatment!!!  The 3 months of brown seaweed had pulled it out. I had read that it would, but did not know that it would do so efficiently! I always took it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a big glass of water due to the iodine.

The radiologist ever freaked out when she saw I had a reaction and said, ""this rarely happens! Let me get another doctor hold on."" That doctor said, ""I think she's having a reaction because she's so small."" To which I said, ""do you give the same amount to everyone?""

So, we're reviewing this set based on our veteran ""eye"" as gardeners.First, we like the array of seeds and they're perfect for a big raised bed we plant fresh each year with seeds.Then, we're also aware that most gardeners, ourselves included, would prefer to buy our seeds either from our favorite garden stores or from our gardening catalogues, selecting each packet of seeds individually. So, the main benefit of this offering is that it's priced quite reasonably. You're getting a dozen packets of seeds here at quite a reduced price, compared with the cost of selecting individual packets.Finally, if you are considering ordering this set, please read more about each variety. Veteran gardeners will recognize right away that this is a set that mixes annuals and perennials. For example, in our experience, dill tends to be an annual, although there are biennial varieties.

Not because it is basic, as it is not but because of its easy page -per-herb layout. Although there is terminology that may yet be foreign to the beginner the wording used throughout this publication is easy to follow and very personable.Leading with an historic introduction Penelopy Ody gives the reader some background into the origins of herbal medicine. Each herb is discussed in terms of its historical background, parts used and applications. There are full-colour photographs to help the reader identify various parts of each plant. This book does not contain some of the herbs you might find in Mrs Grieve's A Modern Herbal but it is a more than adequate source of information particularly for the home user. Unlike some other herbals, Ms Ody includes small sections dedicated to the lesser known herbal lore of Ayurvedic Herbs out of India, Australian bush herbs, South American rainforest remedies and even some types of funghi .Approximately two thirds of the book is herb lore, the remaining third shows the reader what to do with this newly acquired knowledge. Using easy to follow photographs the author takes the reader from harvesting and drying to the techniques involved in making the various remedies. There are basic formulas which can be adapted to many recipes. Charmingly, although the quantities given are standardised, the measurements are provided in metric as well as kitchen utensil equivalent. For example, 62.5mls is given to equal 1 sherry glass whereas 150mls is the same as one tea cup. The section on home remedies goes into the nitty gritty of treating common ailments, suggesting combinations of herbs appropriate for each condition and cautioning the use of some herbs in certain situations.It is fabulous to see a herbal that addresses some issues unique to Australia, includes some of our native bush remedies, is written in non US English and most importantly it contains a comprehensive list of Australian and New Zealand address list of organisations and practitioners.Now the bad news, I have looked high and low to find copies of this book. There are some used copies available on Amazon but I can't find new ones. They may be out there, but even the publishers' website does not feature it in their search engine. Before you howl with disappointment though, there are other versions of the same book. I ended up buying the American version which is almost identical. I have noticed a few exclusions in the herb department, such as Khella and Galangal but then the use of Khella is restricted in Australia anyway. There are over 130 herbs in this version probably based on the use of Native American remedies in the US. Of course there are not the lists of Australian/NZ contacts that I mentioned.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31SSWUSyKYL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41LDZpV5WXL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OtujdA3sL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31tzl4qcN2L.jpg

I would not hesitate to take his book and forage.I did find the recipes at the end difficult to read, as the brown seemed to bleed into the white letters, but not impossible.

I don’t think we have enough Pine Trees to make them worth the mention, though I could be wrong.I appreciated how Mr. Mace stressed sustainable harvesting, not just when to harvest, but how. I thought his ideas on cooking, serving, or saving/preserving were quite well done and appreciated. I would add one more item to my foraging kit: brand name hand sanitizer.

As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal.

After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.

California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called “glutamate” which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don’t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you’re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I’ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ErE1fXrhL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aN0fnenFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ta4W-IuKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AnYHzeOSL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+QNhdArQL._AC_.jpg

May be a dose issue?",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023",False,"I tried this for as-needed calming (rather than taking daily). First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I’m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems. It may help if you’re too wound up to sleep.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KIbPz5ZJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tiyTvNPmL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OTX-E2AfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t+QesskGL._AC_.jpg

I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KIbPz5ZJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tiyTvNPmL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OTX-E2AfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t+QesskGL._AC_.jpg

Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FLWNq2vUL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bNmU4CB5L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mglMM3cvL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Zi+yKEzWS._AC_.jpg

(Note - This Is Not For Pain)",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015",True,"I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OtQndo79L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/316CMENJCPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BtWrlD+sL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xEFBKeZML._AC_.jpg

This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste.

My biggest issue is not falling asleep, but staying asleep particularly in the morning hours. My brain is so active that I can ""worry myself awake"". Very frustrating!The tried-and-true supplement I rely on is RidgeCrest Herbs DreamOn Zen formula. I take TWO doses because of my mind's ability to bust through the herbs and think myself awake anyway.BUT with this, I took two doses and slept very very soundly through the night AND morning! Yay! And I have vivid long dreams which I LOVE.The only potential negative, which I do not care about and do not personally consider to be negative, is that compared to the DreamOn Zen, it doesn't help me fall asleep. I don't have issues falling asleep, but I do notice now that something about DreamOn Zen helped make me feel sleepier and go to sleep faster.My new plan is to take one dose of this plus one dose of DreamOn Zen instead of two doses of either one separately.So if your brain situation sounds like mine, try this.
