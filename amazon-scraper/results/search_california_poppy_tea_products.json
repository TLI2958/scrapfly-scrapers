Native Americans in California prized them as a source of food and for the oil that could be extracted from the plant. Eschscholzia californica was the first named member of the genus Eschscholzia, which was named by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso after the Baltic German botanist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, his friend and colleague on Otto von Kotzebue\u2019s scientific expedition to California and the greater Pacific in mid-1810s aboard the Russian ship Rurik.",
