  "text": "I researched California Poppy in regard to anxiety and trouble sleeping. I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier. I gave some to my husband to try and he had a crazy dream that left him rattled, so it's probably not for everyone but for me it works.",

  "text": "I have used this as sleep enhancing remedy for several months and find it quite effective. I tried Californai Poppy capsules and they do not do the job. I take one dropper full  of this extract in a cup of chamomile tea about an hour before sleep. Straight chamomile does nothing. The poppy  seems to help me wake up on time and be more alert, not over sleep, so it may be helping the quality of  sleep. I dislike the high alcohol level and the taste is truly vile, that is the reason for four stars. Herb Pharm has proved to be a reliable company of quality extracts but they don't make California Poppy in a glycerin, non alcohol form. I still recommend this and suggest putting it in an herb tea to avoid the taste.",

  "text": "I have a very high tolerance for benzodiazepines from years of being prescribed for insomnia, so I researched my problem and landed on studies of  Eschscholzia californica.  As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are \"Alcohol 62%\" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.  THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSUMING BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT.",

I switched over to the California Poppy after doing some reading - I had fantastic results right away. It is a bit strong on it's own as far as flavor. I was waiting for about 45 mins with the CBD oil to feel the calming - the CA Poppy was within 10 mins. I found that my sleep was much deeper as well with the CA poppy. I have not used it for pain as of yet - just sleep. My Son was using Melatonin and I asked him to try this. He also said his sleep was deeper with CA Poppy and he did not feel groggy the next day. Also his anxiety has calmed down as well. I would recommend this for anyone  looking for better sleep and something to give a relaxing state, not for pain relief.",

  "text": "I first heard of California Poppy for pain in 2012 when a segment on Dr. Oz discussed this item.  But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.  They are NOT like a drugs related to poppy flowers (heroin).  They have not shown up during urine drug testing at work.",

My advice is to order outside of amazon a broad spectrum cbd oil or tincture I encourage contacting a local dispensary or online delivery service.  I should listen to my own advice more and will because this isn't returnable nor refundable that's a big chunk  of change I don't anymore.  So read small print and order BROAD SPECTRUM CBD.

The other day I was cooking up a storm and had been in the kitchen for hours, my feet and back were hurting. I took a couple of these babies and before I knew it the foot pain was gone, I felt good enough to go for an hour and a half drive and visit with my daughter (she was up late settling into her own place). Mind you I didn't get back home till 2 o'clock in the morning and I felt pretty good pain wise. That was my first time taking this supplement, now I usually take 2 or 3 at a time- once or twice a day- depending on how bad I feel, I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I saw that the Medical Medium has a California poppy seed shock therapy in his new Brain Protocols book and will give that a try soon.",

However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep. So don't be surprised if you sleep longer than normal.~The Rebecca Review",

  "text": "At first, I thought this product was working well. California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called \u201cglutamate\u201d which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don\u2019t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you\u2019re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I\u2019ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",

When I first tried this product, I experienced much more pronounced effects including better sleep and feeling relaxed and in a good mood when I woke up. This effect seemed to subside to some extent as I continue to take it, but it still seems more powerful than most of the other brands I've tried.",

  "text": "I tried this for as-needed calming (rather than taking daily). First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I\u2019m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems. It may help if you\u2019re too wound up to sleep.",

  "text": "This was the first California Poppy supplement I took.  I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.",

  "text": "This product is absolutely amazing. Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",

  "text": "I ordered California Poppy and Valerian. I got straight Valerian, no poppy at all. And Valerian smells so bad, like the worst dog breath ever! I will try to return it for the correct one.Update: I returned the mismarked product and reordered. I got the right one the second time. It also smells bad, but the taste is sweet and floral.  How is that even possible? I have no idea. I take 100ml before bed, rather than the recommeded 70ml.  It does seem to help me relax and get to sleep more easily.  I do not take it for pain. But it seems to help a little with anxiety if I take it as recommended (70ml) during the day. I will probably buy iy again.",

  "text": "I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night. Both poppy extract and a few bong loads of wild lettuce have proved to be effective for my occasional sleep or minor pain problems.",

  "text": "There are many products available which induce sleep in a variety of ways. The type of sleep also varies, as sleep comes at several different levels. Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste. So this California Poppy extract would be effective for occasional sleepless nights. I cannot offer an opinion about long term results.",

I am never used poppy before so I don\u2019t know exactly how I should use it and wish they provided better direction.  It doesn\u2019t say to use it before bed and doesn\u2019t warn about using it while driving or doing other things that require your attention.  I am taking one in the morning and it is too soon to see if I feel more relaxed during the day or sleep better.  I put a photo against another bottle to show that it comes in a bottle about half the size of other bottles.  I applaud the company for this as too often you get a lot of unnecessary packaging and this company seems to be sensitive to that issue.",

  "text": "As a practicing herbalist for many years (for personal use, not as a professional) and an advocate holistic practices I've found that Gaia herbs has always had quality products and I was happy to find this one available here on Subscribe and Save.  My family has been taking both formulas of the Black Elderberry syrup (the standard version and the Nighttime) as a supplements throughout the cold and flu season with excellent results.It's concentrated. You take one teaspoonful once a day, twice only if needed. I've found that it's not overly sedative which is a plus.  It has something of a mild relaxing effect keeping in mind that your mileage may vary.  The potency of the formula is focused in the immunity support that the Black Elderberries provide. It's manufactured in Italy where it's a traditional medicine with these additional organic ingredients:  Acerola, California Poppy, Lemon Balm, Grindelia, Sugar Cane (4g of sugar per serving), water, and Lemon Juice. I've come to really like this product and will be sure to keep a bottle of each formula on hand all year round, so I recommend it highly.",

My brain is so active that I can \"worry myself awake\". Very frustrating!The tried-and-true supplement I rely on is RidgeCrest Herbs DreamOn Zen formula. I take TWO doses because of my mind's ability to bust through the herbs and think myself awake anyway.BUT with this, I took two doses and slept very very soundly through the night AND morning! Yay! And I have vivid long dreams which I LOVE.The only potential negative, which I do not care about and do not personally consider to be negative, is that compared to the DreamOn Zen, it doesn't help me fall asleep. I don't have issues falling asleep, but I do notice now that something about DreamOn Zen helped make me feel sleepier and go to sleep faster.My new plan is to take one dose of this plus one dose of DreamOn Zen instead of two doses of either one separately.So if your brain situation sounds like mine, try this. And honestly I also highly recommend trying DreamOn Zen too.",

After trying their product and finding that it did nothing for me, even after more than doubling the recommended dosage I tried to return it and ended on a chat that supposedly approved my return, but could not tell me where to mail the product. It told me to use the rerun address in my confirmation email, but there was no return address in said email. Then I was directed to call the customer service line, but when I did what I got was a recoded message selling me new products and subscriptions. And though I said I wasn\u2019t interested I was transferred to said promotions, since it was a non interactive recording, which transferred to the promotional line regardless of my response. There was no life person to talk to. In other words I got approval to return, but was given zero directions or guidance on how to make said return.I call that a scam.",

Of 8 species the only 2 native species are California poppy (many seeds) and Clarkia unguiculata (very few seeds). This is especially bad when you have a garden with otherwise only native plants since many of these species are spreading very easily (and have become introduced in many places in North America).",

  "text": "Alright, y'all, let me spill the tea (or should I say soda?) on how I\u2019ve totally revamped my drink game. I used to be a sucker for regular sodas and my daily Starbucks run, but then I discovered Poppi sodas and Yerba Magic, and my life has never been the same. Let me tell you why I made the switch and why I\u2019m never looking back!First up, Poppi sodas. These babies are a game changer! If you haven\u2019t heard of them, they\u2019re these gut-friendly sodas that taste amazing. I used to drink regular sodas all the time, but we all know those aren\u2019t the best for our health. Poppi, on the other hand, is packed with apple cider vinegar and prebiotics, so it\u2019s actually good for your gut. Plus, the flavors are to die for \u2013 Strawberry Lemon, Raspberry Rose, you name it. It\u2019s like a party in your mouth, but with benefits!Switching from normal soda to Poppi was a no-brainer. I get the fizzy, refreshing goodness I love without the sugar crash. And my tummy is happier, too! Seriously, my gut has never felt this good. It\u2019s like giving your digestive system a high-five with every sip.Now, let\u2019s talk about my Starbucks habit. I used to be all about that morning coffee fix, but the jitters and the inevitable crash? Not so much. Enter Yerba Magic. This instant yerba mate drink has totally transformed my mornings. It's super easy to make \u2013 just mix the powder with water, hot or cold, and boom \u2013 you\u2019re ready to roll. The peach mango flavor is absolutely delicious, and it gives me the energy boost I need without the downsides of coffee.Yerba Magic is packed with prebiotics and probiotics, which have done wonders for my gut health. Plus, the blend of yerba mate extract, L-Theanine, and nootropics like Lions\u2019 mane mushroom and Bacopa Monnieri keeps me focused and alert all day long. No jitters, no crashes, just smooth, steady energy. It\u2019s like having a magic potion to kickstart my day! I get it off Amazon if you want to boost your gut health too:\n  \nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5YVMX9Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    So, here\u2019s the deal: switching from normal soda to Poppi and from Starbucks to Yerba Magic has been one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made for my health. Poppi keeps my soda cravings satisfied with added gut health benefits, and Yerba Magic gives me the perfect morning boost without the coffee crash.If you\u2019re looking to shake up your drink routine, give these a try. Trust me, your taste buds and your tummy will thank you! It\u2019s all about making those small upgrades to your lifestyle that transform your health at the end of the day\u2026 but it\u2019s sort of a no brainer when both of these are so delicious.",

  "text": "I've tried several flavors of Poppi Soda so far and overall I have enjoyed them. Poppi has a good variety and a nice bubbles when you need that fizzy drink with whatever you are eating. The sugar is low, but there still is a decent amount of calories in them.  I'm not sure about the prebiotics, unfortunately. I can't say I noticed a difference and I really wish they would list the amount of prebiotics on the bottle. For health benefits it's a nice alternative to soda, but how much would I have to drink to really get health benefits from Poppi?The flavors can either be subtle in comparison to soda or too much. I liked the subtle ones, but the strong ones just don't cut it for me.Classical Cola: is nowhere close to regular cola, but more like a cream soda. Still drinkable.Doc Pop: weak compared to the Doctor's of Pepper, but enough flavor where you can taste it, but it does not fully satisfy like its competitor. Will continue to drink.Lemon Lime: didn't care for this one; lemon is strong wherever Poppi Soda you are drinking. Won't drink.Root Beer: the flavor of root beer is definitely there, however, there are some spices in an after taste that makes this one a No for me.Raspberry Rose: very nice subtle flavor and good mix. Reminds me of a zesty raspberry iced tea. Will continue to drink.Strawberry Lemon: much like Lemon Lime there's a weird imbalance of flavors and the lemon is too strong. Won't drink.Cherry Limeade: refreshing and good mix of flavor. One of the few with flavor that is neither too subtle or too overbearing. Still drinkable.Orange: the best one of the bunch! The flavor is there and it's just orange. Really the only one that I tried so far that comes close to beating regular orange soda. Will continue to drink.If I could I would rate Poppi Soda a 3.5 stars, but I gave them 4 because their Orange soda is most certainly a winner!",

  "text": "I love this Raspberry flavor!! I was getting worried (or a least thinking more maturely) about my Mountain Dew consumption and needed a cold, fizzy, refreshing alternative. This hit the spot! Granted, some nights at work I still grab a Mountain Dew for the caffeine. But mostly I stick with this. It's a little pricey, but with inflation the way it is now, even the sugary beverages are getting expensive. So this is my special treat to myself that leaves me feeling guilt-free about the content (been reading a lot of books lately about the harm of carbohydrates in order to help diabetic family members).I've tried some of the other flavors too but don't care much for lemonade or grape or cherry flavors, or Dr. Pepper or Root Beer anyway so I just stick with this one. The cola flavor tasted weirdly like banana which was very disappointing (but hey! If you like banana try it out!). I recently tried the mixed berry flavor and found it a bit too sweet for my taste but one of my brothers tried it and liked it. I still need to find a single can of the lemon-lime flavor.",

T ingredients are much healthier & t sugar & carbs are minimal, it definitely took some getting used to. I only like t Cherry Poppi-& while t carbonation is good, you can taste cinnamon which isn\u2019t bad& t carbonation lasts much longer than regular soda.It tastes similar to the fountain cherry cokes . All in all I would say it\u2019s a good alternative to regular sodas, if you\u2019re trying to eat more healthy. If you purchase, I would start out with the variety pack, to see which one is the best for you.\ud83d\ude0a",

My advice is to order outside of amazon a broad spectrum cbd oil or tincture I encourage contacting a local dispensary or online delivery service.  I should listen to my own advice more and will because this isn't returnable nor refundable that's a big chunk  of change I don't anymore.  So read small print and order BROAD SPECTRUM CBD.

  "text": "I first heard of California Poppy for pain in 2012 when a segment on Dr. Oz discussed this item.  But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.  They are NOT like a drugs related to poppy flowers (heroin).  They have not shown up during urine drug testing at work.",

  "text": "I researched California Poppy in regard to anxiety and trouble sleeping. I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier. I gave some to my husband to try and he had a crazy dream that left him rattled, so it's probably not for everyone but for me it works.",

I take one dropper full  of this extract in a cup of chamomile tea about an hour before sleep. Straight chamomile does nothing. The poppy  seems to help me wake up on time and be more alert, not over sleep, so it may be helping the quality of  sleep. I dislike the high alcohol level and the taste is truly vile, that is the reason for four stars. Herb Pharm has proved to be a reliable company of quality extracts but they don't make California Poppy in a glycerin, non alcohol form.

  "text": "I have a very high tolerance for benzodiazepines from years of being prescribed for insomnia, so I researched my problem and landed on studies of  Eschscholzia californica.  As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are \"Alcohol 62%\" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.  THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSUMING BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT.",

  "text": "I saw the many positive reviews on here and read some various literature online touting the wonderful relaxing effects of California poppy extract. I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain. I suppose it works for some people, but it definitely didn't do a thing for me.",

It\u2019s quite a small bag, which would feel more acceptable if the seller didn\u2019t send it along with a HUGE sample of some other tea I never asked for. Thanks for the sample, but I have a ton of black tea already. It feels like compensating for how tiny the package I actually ordered is? Just send me a little bit more of the thing I actually wanted to get from you, instead of a massive sample of something else. That\u2019s my hot take.",

  "text": "At first, I thought this product was working well. California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called \u201cglutamate\u201d which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don\u2019t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you\u2019re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I\u2019ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",

  "text": "These pills are a godsend they are narcotic-free and really help to manage my pain. The other day I was cooking up a storm and had been in the kitchen for hours, my feet and back were hurting. I took a couple of these babies and before I knew it the foot pain was gone, I felt good enough to go for an hour and a half drive and visit with my daughter (she was up late settling into her own place). Mind you I didn't get back home till 2 o'clock in the morning and I felt pretty good pain wise. That was my first time taking this supplement, now I usually take 2 or 3 at a time- once or twice a day- depending on how bad I feel, I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I saw that the Medical Medium has a California poppy seed shock therapy in his new Brain Protocols book and will give that a try soon.",

However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep. So don't be surprised if you sleep longer than normal.~The Rebecca Review",

When I first tried this product, I experienced much more pronounced effects including better sleep and feeling relaxed and in a good mood when I woke up. This effect seemed to subside to some extent as I continue to take it, but it still seems more powerful than most of the other brands I've tried.",

  "text": "I tried this for as-needed calming (rather than taking daily). First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I\u2019m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems. It may help if you\u2019re too wound up to sleep.",

  "text": "This was the first California Poppy supplement I took.  I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.",

  "description": "California Poppies are native to California and Oregon; and are the California state flower. They are listed as a Tender Perennial (short lived) but are most often treated as an annual. They are easy to grow from seed, plant in the fall in mild climates or in the spring. Sow seeds directly as poppies do not transplant easily. California poppies are a great addition to any informal garden and are especially good in rock gardens. Deadheading and light irrigation will encourage blooming throughout the summer. Plant in full sun and in poor to moderate, well drained, soils. California poppies are drought tolerant and generally reseed well.",

  "text": "This product is absolutely amazing. Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",

I will try to return it for the correct one.Update: I returned the mismarked product and reordered. I got the right one the second time. It also smells bad, but the taste is sweet and floral.  How is that even possible? I have no idea. I take 100ml before bed, rather than the recommeded 70ml.  It does seem to help me relax and get to sleep more easily.  I do not take it for pain. But it seems to help a little with anxiety if I take it as recommended (70ml) during the day. I will probably buy iy again.",

  "text": "I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night. Both poppy extract and a few bong loads of wild lettuce have proved to be effective for my occasional sleep or minor pain problems.",

  "text": "There are many products available which induce sleep in a variety of ways. The type of sleep also varies, as sleep comes at several different levels. Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste. So this California Poppy extract would be effective for occasional sleepless nights. I cannot offer an opinion about long term results.",

I began to get stiff and sore as I awoke and it hit me that after the week I had taken it I was pain free.

  "text": "As a practicing herbalist for many years (for personal use, not as a professional) and an advocate holistic practices I've found that Gaia herbs has always had quality products and I was happy to find this one available here on Subscribe and Save.  My family has been taking both formulas of the Black Elderberry syrup (the standard version and the Nighttime) as a supplements throughout the cold and flu season with excellent results.It's concentrated. You take one teaspoonful once a day, twice only if needed. I've found that it's not overly sedative which is a plus.  It has something of a mild relaxing effect keeping in mind that your mileage may vary.  The potency of the formula is focused in the immunity support that the Black Elderberries provide. It's manufactured in Italy where it's a traditional medicine with these additional organic ingredients:  Acerola, California Poppy, Lemon Balm, Grindelia, Sugar Cane (4g of sugar per serving), water, and Lemon Juice. I've come to really like this product and will be sure to keep a bottle of each formula on hand all year round, so I recommend it highly.",

She still get sniffles or a very low grade fever (once in a blue moon!) but I honestly believe she would be worse without elderberry. This stuff just helps the healing and protecting of my little one's immune system. She enjoys the taste. She doesn't spit or gage. I do notice it takes awhile 7-10 days for it to be effective. I really do  think this is a long term routine. Always nice to have natural remedies for the little one's!",

They sprouted immediately, but alas, the wild bunnies seem to think they were delicious, so this review is from them.\u201cThe nice lady who owns they property we live on,  was nice enough to plant all 10 thousand California Poppy seeds.  She worked so hard on preparing the soil, fertilizing and watering them for 10 days straight.  To our delight, they sprouted and when they were 2\u201d tall, we only meant to nibble just one, but couldn\u2019t help ourselves.  We ate all of them, overnight! What a treat for us wild bunnies.  We hope she does it again next year, they were yummy!",

I decided to try this since it was touted as a more natural alternative to the codones...and man, has it been a life saver! I just bought some passionflower and st.john's wort in dried form from another source to use as a calming tea at night, since sleep deprivation is one of the biggest issues in my fibromyalgia. I'm excited to see how those will work together. But as far as this product - it truly has been a life-saver and I'm only sorry that I waited so long to order the second bottle!",

Alas, as a light sleeper, I sometimes wake from the intensity of a dream, so as a sleep aid it isn't helping, but as an entertainment, it is.

There are no directions or pictures with the packaging, so don't be discouraged by the presentation.  To plant, choose a spot with lots of sun, turn the soil a bit and keep some of that soil to one side.  Add some amendment to your soil, scatter the seeds and cover with the layer of soil you had set aside.
