Unfortunately I had no relief and the tast3 is one of those that makes arm hair stand up and gave me w fit of the heabie jeebies.  Its very caustic in the mouth, I felt a burning sensation.  My advice is to order outside of amazon a broad spectrum cbd oil or tincture I encourage contacting a local dispensary or online delivery service.  I should listen to my own advice more and will because this isn't returnable nor refundable that's a big chunk  of change I don't anymore.  So read small print and order BROAD SPECTRUM CBD.

  "text": "I researched California Poppy in regard to anxiety and trouble sleeping. I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier. I gave some to my husband to try and he had a crazy dream that left him rattled, so it's probably not for everyone but for me it works.",

I take one dropper full  of this extract in a cup of chamomile tea about an hour before sleep. Straight chamomile does nothing. The poppy  seems to help me wake up on time and be more alert, not over sleep, so it may be helping the quality of  sleep. I dislike the high alcohol level and the taste is truly vile, that is the reason for four stars. Herb Pharm has proved to be a reliable company of quality extracts but they don't make California Poppy in a glycerin, non alcohol form. I still recommend this and suggest putting it in an herb tea to avoid the taste.",

  "text": "I have a very high tolerance for benzodiazepines from years of being prescribed for insomnia, so I researched my problem and landed on studies of  Eschscholzia californica.  As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are \"Alcohol 62%\" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.  THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSUMING BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT.",

  "text": "I saw the many positive reviews on here and read some various literature online touting the wonderful relaxing effects of California poppy extract. I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain. I suppose it works for some people, but it definitely didn't do a thing for me.",

As for the taste, most herbal tinctures taste awful. (why would anyone think it would taste nice?) However the taste is not that bad and is quite easily masked in a drink of some sort.

  "text": "At first, I thought this product was working well. California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called \u201cglutamate\u201d which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don\u2019t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you\u2019re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I\u2019ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",

  "text": "I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night. Both poppy extract and a few bong loads of wild lettuce have proved to be effective for my occasional sleep or minor pain problems.",

Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste. So this California Poppy extract would be effective for occasional sleepless nights. I cannot offer an opinion about long term results.",

Alas, as a light sleeper, I sometimes wake from the intensity of a dream, so as a sleep aid it isn't helping, but as an entertainment, it is.

  "text": "This product is absolutely amazing. Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",

I will try to return it for the correct one.Update: I returned the mismarked product and reordered. I got the right one the second time. It also smells bad, but the taste is sweet and floral.  How is that even possible? I have no idea. I take 100ml before bed, rather than the recommeded 70ml.  It does seem to help me relax and get to sleep more easily.  I do not take it for pain. But it seems to help a little with anxiety if I take it as recommended (70ml) during the day. I will probably buy iy again.",

I put it into water and it turns into a cloudy white color. The taste isn't bad, but very herbal. Usually within 20 minutes of taking a dose, I feel very tranquil and relaxed and ready for sleep. It is really good for when I have to wake up early the next morning and can't seem to wind down early enough for bedtime. Before, I would lie awake for hours staring at the ceiling until the first sunlight started coming through the window, knowing I'd have to get up in an hour or so. Now when I need it, I can lay down and fall asleep peacefully. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs an occasional herbal sleep aid.",

  "text": "I've had amazing successes  with kava/poppy. My recent experiences were related to playing solos and juries (end of the semester tests/reviews before the music faculty) during my undergrad education--I majored in music. At this time, my anxiety was just starting to emerge into a problem. I took the recommended dose, on the low side, and found it did wonders to \"take the edge off\" and allow me to automatically relax my breathing and heart rate and not follow any negative trains of thought. It had a tranquil, peaceful emotional effect as well. But subtle.  One final note, I've noticed a more immediate and profound effect from Sense herbal mix tincture than from taking these herbs earlier in any form separately. Weird. May be this is because they were grown in Hawaii?",

  "text": "I first heard of California Poppy for pain in 2012 when a segment on Dr. Oz discussed this item.  But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.  They are NOT like a drugs related to poppy flowers (heroin).  They have not shown up during urine drug testing at work.",

  "text": "It\u2019s a Friday night, and I\u2019m staring at a mountain of laundry that seems more like Everest after a long week. Normally, I\u2019d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different\u2014a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I\u2019d heard these were supposed to be nature\u2019s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn\u2019t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity\u2014who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I\u2019d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn\u2019t feel groggy or out of it\u2014just calm, focused, and oddly energized. Even my usual Saturday errands felt less like a chore and more like a leisurely stroll through the day.",

I could almost believe these had THAT kind of poppy in them (they do no actually have that kind of poppy. \ud83d\ude42)  I'm happy to have these on hand, as they have proven so far to be a surefire knockout inducer.

  "text": "This was my very first experience with wild lettuce and poppyseed and I'm pleasantly surprised at how effective they are for me.  I struggle with a lot of chronic pain that is made worse by tension and anxiety, it's like a vicious cycle so I wanted to find something to help break that cycle and hopefully help my body and mind relax.  I decided to give these a try and I am super glad I did.  The first time I took these I started to relax and my muscles started to loosen and some of the pain eased up and in turned eased my mind.....these are now a regular supplement, especially while I wait to be scheduled for hip replacement (yeah....ouch).  I sleep better now and that helps immensely!  I'll be back for more!",

I enclosed a photo of my old loose leaf ( almost finished) tea beside what I received from Nelson.  You can see for yourself.  Despite the evidence, the seller denied the deceitful advertisement and denied my returning his loose stems ( for obvious reason).  When a seller denies a return, the seller does not refund.  Amazon did reimburse me with their A to Z policy.  Be aware of this and try finding a real loose leaf tea of California Poppy.  It's a wonderful tea when the leaves are there.",

  "text": "I tried this for as-needed calming (rather than taking daily). First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I\u2019m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems. It may help if you\u2019re too wound up to sleep.",

  "text": "This was the first California Poppy supplement I took.  I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.",

It seemed to work most of the time. Then I decided to try one on a Saturday morning around 10am to see how it helped with anxiety. It didn't seem to have much of an effect,if any. However, that's not to say they won't work for someone else. I did continue to use it AM and PM for a couple of weeks and for me, it doesn't seem to have much of an effect during the daytime that I could tell. But for sleep, it helped most of the time.",

  "text": "I am a very light sleeper with a racing mind. My biggest issue is not falling asleep, but staying asleep particularly in the morning hours. My brain is so active that I can \"worry myself awake\". Very frustrating!The tried-and-true supplement I rely on is RidgeCrest Herbs DreamOn Zen formula. I take TWO doses because of my mind's ability to bust through the herbs and think myself awake anyway.BUT with this, I took two doses and slept very very soundly through the night AND morning! Yay! And I have vivid long dreams which I LOVE.The only potential negative, which I do not care about and do not personally consider to be negative, is that compared to the DreamOn Zen, it doesn't help me fall asleep. I don't have issues falling asleep, but I do notice now that something about DreamOn Zen helped make me feel sleepier and go to sleep faster.My new plan is to take one dose of this plus one dose of DreamOn Zen instead of two doses of either one separately.So if your brain situation sounds like mine, try this. And honestly I also highly recommend trying DreamOn Zen too.",

After trying their product and finding that it did nothing for me, even after more than doubling the recommended dosage I tried to return it and ended on a chat that supposedly approved my return, but could not tell me where to mail the product. It told me to use the rerun address in my confirmation email, but there was no return address in said email. Then I was directed to call the customer service line, but when I did what I got was a recoded message selling me new products and subscriptions. And though I said I wasn\u2019t interested I was transferred to said promotions, since it was a non interactive recording, which transferred to the promotional line regardless of my response. There was no life person to talk to. In other words I got approval to return, but was given zero directions or guidance on how to make said return.I call that a scam.",

The other day I was cooking up a storm and had been in the kitchen for hours, my feet and back were hurting. I took a couple of these babies and before I knew it the foot pain was gone, I felt good enough to go for an hour and a half drive and visit with my daughter (she was up late settling into her own place). Mind you I didn't get back home till 2 o'clock in the morning and I felt pretty good pain wise. That was my first time taking this supplement, now I usually take 2 or 3 at a time- once or twice a day- depending on how bad I feel, I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

  "text": "This supplement did not help my back pain when my back went out so I'm not sure what type of pain relief it is capable of giving. However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep. So don't be surprised if you sleep longer than normal.~The Rebecca Review",

  "text": "The seeds bloomed. The flowers are pretty and lovely just as you imagine what California poppy should look like. I learned that wild flowers don't like transplanting. When I tried to transplant from the ground to the pots, I didn't succeed. All failed. Next time, when I want to share California poppy with others, I will scatter the seeds on the dirt in the pot and place them on the ground. Thank you so much for the product! Also, one friend of mine from Japan was impressed by the plants when they were before blooming, and she took a trip down to southern California to see the super bloom. She and her husband enjoyed the trip. I'm glad I had this opportunity this year so they could have a great vacation.",

  "text": "A coworker of mine put me onto this. She brought me a tincture that she got from a local nutrition place in my town for me to try and I had to RUN to find some of my own. Hers was very bitter tasting, like a shot of vodka, so I was worried about that but THIS is pleasant in comparison. I did get the alcohol free bottle. It\u2019s got a slightly sweet taste. Almost almondy. I tried a tad bit plain just to see. I did mix the vial dose in my tea and it was actually kind of a nice  subtle addition to sweeten it up. The tea I used is Celestial brand, Bengal Spice. Will be perfect if you like cinnamon and ginger. And I do already feel the calming effects of it. I gave four stars because I can\u2019t speak for how my osteoarthritis, plantar fasciitis and over all body pain will respond to it yet.  I do however, look forward to seeing how this works for my anxiety in the long term as that was the sole reason for my purchase.",

  "text": "This stuff has worked really well for me. Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don\u2019t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I\u2019m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I\u2019ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I\u2019m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there\u2019s still some energy to spare. I\u2019m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It\u2019s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I\u2019m often working double shifts a day and I\u2019m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it\u2019s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I\u2019m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I\u2019ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",

The taste is so repugnant and lingers for minutes after unless you eat something super tart. If you try this I\u2019d recommend chasing with a super tart lemonade or going with the non-alcohol version. I seriously don\u2019t know if I can finish this product, as the thought of having to endure another round of this makes me vomit in my mouth a little.",

  "text": "I love the choice of ingredients and the fact that it\u2019s certified organic too. It\u2019s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it\u2019s hard for me to get a \u201cfull\u201d dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there\u2019s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don\u2019t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally \u2014 the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don\u2019t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I\u2019d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I\u2019ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it\u2019s such a strange combination of flavors I\u2019m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.  In a pinch I would use this but I think I\u2019d prefer a pill or just a simple elderberry gummy instead.  Just my preference anyway.  Otherwise the product itself is clean and seems to be an excellent way to boost your immune system when necessary.",

  "text": "This item is a 30ml amber bottle of organic herb tincture that is plant based and formulated to provide immunity support. The bottle includes an eye dropper cap that is used to deliver the recommended 2 dropper full of the liquid. The ingredients includes extracts of echinacea, elderberry, thyme, sage, yarrow, and lemon balm in a proprietary combination. The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity. The liquid tastes quite bad so I recommend adding the 2 dropper full to some juice. I appreciate that it's made in the USA. I find the price point for 20 days supply to be rather steep. Overall, it's not a bad tincture to add to your daily supplement regiment, but it's not something I will continue to use given I have other more cost effective immunity support supplements.",

  "text": "I love this stuff. As a pediatric nurse, I take numerous measures to make sure I stay well and don\u2019t bring any illnesses to my patients. One of those measures is a daily dose of high dose elderberry. I used to take Sambucus Immune, but I\u2019ve recently started the keto diet and that particular liquid formula has 8 carbs per serving, so it\u2019s a no go for me (but my daughter stays well on it)! This product is the highest strength I\u2019ve found available in capsule form. I\u2019ve been taking this product over 30 days and during that time, I\u2019ve been in close quarters with several people with viruses like norovirus (stomach flu) and only once did I feel just a little queasy for one afternoon. I took a double dose that night and the next morning I felt at 100%. After that, I go ahead and double up when I\u2019m knowingly around someone sick. Ultimately, I\u2019m very pleased with this product and highly recommend it to anyone.",

I take it every time I feel like I am \"coming down with something\" and within 24 hours I am completely better!  It is great to take daily to keep from getting sick during the winter when lots of viruses and such are going around. I even opened up the capsule and poured into some food for my 4 year old when she was sick with a bad cold and she felt better that same day. I 100% stand behind this product from GAIA.  It's also good for those with allergies and can help minimize symptoms if taken daily or reduce the need for allergy medicine.",

  "text": "** UPDATED FOR JUNE 2017, scroll down to read ** Bought twice. The first time I ordered a bottle I got Liquid Phyto-Capsules, the second time I ordered I recived capsules that seemed to either have powder in them or the liquid has dried up. The date on the bottle says 10/19, so I'm pretty sure they're not expired. I've been taking them like I normally would, but it's just...odd, because I know they're not supposed to look like this (unless they've changed?). I will still order these, I'm just confused. Hopefully I won't get sick or anything, I have 34 capsules left and I take two every morning.UPDATE: 6/12/17So I ordered another bottle a few days ago and received the bottle, to which on the box it stated that it was a new and improved formula. The capsules looked exactly like the ones that inspired me to write this review, they looked like the capsules in the picture. So the company finally got around to making it official that they changed the formula, on the box. I can't say for sure if this new formula works better than the old one, as I was sure that they were onto something with the liquid inside the capsule. Oh well. I ordered the elderberry syrup as well (not the nighttime one) and I take that sometimes when I need the extra help and want the benefits of having the liquid. So I guess just be aware that there's the change to the formula. Too bad they couldn't have just made another version of this capsule and kept this one with liquid inside. But I guess they know what they're doing.",

  "text": "My friend's twin sister, a midwife, recommended this to us two years ago and since then it's helped boost my immunity to every sniffle that comes around, and has made my allergies more manageable. I love this stuff. There's an increasing amount of scientific literature proving the efficacy of elderberry extract in immunity boosting. Amazon has the best prices on Gaia (60 for the price of 30 at Whole Foods), and the capsules are easy to swallow, whereas the syrup is very, very sweet and can be off putting. All of that being said, after six months of ordering it, I have to share this photo of the packaging to shame Amazon into a less wasteful shipping method. The box of capsules in a bubble wrap lined envelope would work just as well.",

  "text": "A coworker of mine put me onto this. She brought me a tincture that she got from a local nutrition place in my town for me to try and I had to RUN to find some of my own. Hers was very bitter tasting, like a shot of vodka, so I was worried about that but THIS is pleasant in comparison. I did get the alcohol free bottle. It\u2019s got a slightly sweet taste. Almost almondy. I tried a tad bit plain just to see. I did mix the vial dose in my tea and it was actually kind of a nice  subtle addition to sweeten it up. The tea I used is Celestial brand, Bengal Spice. Will be perfect if you like cinnamon and ginger. And I do already feel the calming effects of it. I gave four stars because I can\u2019t speak for how my osteoarthritis, plantar fasciitis and over all body pain will respond to it yet.  I do however, look forward to seeing how this works for my anxiety in the long term as that was the sole reason for my purchase.",

  "text": "This stuff has worked really well for me. Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don\u2019t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I\u2019m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I\u2019ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I\u2019m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there\u2019s still some energy to spare. I\u2019m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It\u2019s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I\u2019m often working double shifts a day and I\u2019m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it\u2019s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I\u2019m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I\u2019ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",

I\u2019d already been taking Ashwagandha supplements as capsule and decided to try the tincture since my experience with the Lemon Balm was so pleasant. But that\u2019s where I was wrong. The taste is so repugnant and lingers for minutes after unless you eat something super tart. If you try this I\u2019d recommend chasing with a super tart lemonade or going with the non-alcohol version. I seriously don\u2019t know if I can finish this product, as the thought of having to endure another round of this makes me vomit in my mouth a little.",

  "text": "I habe been taking valerian for a while intermittently to help me sleep. The liquid works better and faster than pill form. I was so thrilled to fund some affordable ones on amazon because it's difficult to justify a trip to sprouts for just one item and I have 2 small kids to tote around. This is a great quality product. It doesn't habe the alcohol burn like some Valerian liquids do. It does taste terrible when you first use it, but it doesn't really bother me. You kinda ha e to experiment with how much you need, I usually use about 1/4 to 1/2 of the dropper to get the effect I want.  This is also good for headaches and for relaxing as well. It works well for me as a sleep aid. I take it 30 minutes before I intend to go to sleep and it works amazingly!  No groggy feeling in the morning unless I took too much, but it's not like taking a sleeping pill or benadryl sort of groggy. I've never missed my alarm or slept til noon with this. Like I said experiment with how much you need. A while dropper full was too much for me and I'm slim,  5'6, in my mid 30s, for a reference, if size plays a part or just show tolerant you are with sleep aids.  Hope this helps!  Gove it a try, I promise it's worth it for a good night's sleep!!",

If you get a bit anxious about getting locked into a \"bus\" with 200 strangers and taken up to 30 or 40 thousand feet, I suggest you try this Valerian. You will probably have to try how much to take depending on your size, height, etc. I would suggest you try it out on the ground first. And of course you should always check with your physician, and check out any interaction possibilities with anything else, medications, alcohol, etc. I find it helpful for many stressful situations; but anything like this, herbal or not, is a very personal choice. I find this to be a mild herbal helper for all types of stressful situations. Also, I have not found it to be addictive. It's just there when I need it. Honestly, sometimes i forget to take it, and I learn that I was more courageous than I gave myself credit for. Do your due diligence checking it out for yourself first. For some people it is a great help.",

The second one I bought seems to have gone rancid fairly quick so I figured I would replace it sooner and with the larger volume.I opened this bottle and noticed it was much lighter than the prior 2 bottles I have had. The color has been a very dark amber, almost syrup color. This one was also much thinner. It wouldn't stay in the dropper, it was so thin. I tried it anyway. BIG mistake. It was almost straight alcohol. Very disappointed.",

  "text": "I have taken Lemon Balm previously and always felt supported by it.I like this Lemon Balm a lot!I originally decided to get it based on the brand's exceptional reputation,  and my past experiences with this brand in trying other products that I felt were high quality.Another big reason I decided to buy this is because there in no alcohol in it.  I'd rather get a quality product not with alcohol when possible and so grateful that this one exists!The value is great.I couldn't believe that after one day of using this, I slept better than I have in a long time.I felt well rested and I didn't wake up several times during the night.It's very easy to use and has a seal to show it was new and untampered with.Easy squeeze and dropper to get the right amount listed on bottle.Overall, I have to say this has been beneficial for me and has also helped overall mood support and helps me calm down and I feel less stress.I will continue to take it and see how it supports me and if any changes I will update.Overall I am very happy with this product, brand and the seller.",

Taste like grass to me. I watched a video of MM the other day and he put his in a glass with a little bit of water. So that\u2019s what I did and it tasted better. Just a little bit of room temp water in a cup and couple drops of lemon balm and I could hardly taste it. Hope this helps someone else!",

  "text": "it isn't sweet like some others, but its not that bad. reading the reviews I thought it would be terrible tasting &/or bitter. It DOES taste a heck of a lot better than lemon balm in alcohol! I would describe it as neutral in terms of sweetness with a pronounced herby quality. For what I need it for, its great!Both bottle & dropper are glass.the 10:1 concentration is very strong; more than the 3:1 I used to use & way stronger than the 1:3 my neighborhood organic foods grocery sells. I cannot see throught the 10:1 in the dropper; it looks more see thru in the other concentrations, esp. in the 1:3the bottle reccomends 30 drops per serving which I've found is just shy of a 1/4 tsp (so about a 1/4 tsp measure full with a very concave meniscus)value-wise then, this stuff is a bargan.",

  "text": "Bought this as a supplement to unwind after a long day and feel ready for bed a bit earlier than i tend to get to bed but unfortunately it didn't do anything and the taste was terrible. I tend to feel very wired after i get back from the office and it prevents me from getting to bed at the hour that I would prefer, so i was very hopeful that this could be the solution as I don't drink during the week.  Not only was it not enjoyable to drink but it had zero effect on my mood or my state of relaxation. I'm not sure what I'm missing from the people raving about it on the reviews but perhaps its a bit of a placebo effect for some?  I find much better results from taking Ashwagandha and Kava Tea and/or melatonin.",

I have always been a good sleeper once asleep, but my smart watch is showing I'm sleeping deeper than normal since I started taking the product. So as a sleep aid it has been phenomenal.I need to take about a serving and a half (30 ish drops) to feel the tension relief in my muscles, and then I almost sleep too hard and have a harder time waking up in the morning. A non alcoholic hangover if you would? hahaI feel better in other ways too but it is hard to separate if I feel better because of the product or because I'm not drinking alcohol before bed.My skin looks great, mood is improved, focus is good. All the things.People complain about the price point, and yes, for 1.2 oz $30 seems steep, but if you figure it replaces one alcoholic drink a night, it's already breaking even or saving you money.I put it in a juice and sparkling water drink, and I've never noticed a taste.I'm excited to try their other flavors/versions.",

It definitely tastes more like an herbal tea than wine, but it\u2019s pleasant. I\u2019m experimenting with adding 2 droppers full to some room temperature sparkling water and a splash of no sugar added cranberry juice. It looks pretty in the glass, tastes ok, and I do feel more relaxed after drinking. I would say if you\u2019re hesitating because of the price, just go for it and play around with how to take it.

  "text": "There aren't many reviews for this product yet so I'm sharing my experience and the experiences of two other people I know that take this Cryptolepis because I believe that this is a high quality product that may help those with Lyme Disease or other infections.I was taking Montana Farmacy's Cryptolepis for Lyme Disease because that brand seemed to be a trusted source with plenty of positive reviews. I can't say that I noticed any difference while taking it myself. Fast forward a few months and someone I know was diagnosed with Lyme and asked me for some herbal recommendations. Amazon was out of the Montana Farmacy brand at that time so I searched and found this one instead. It's made in the USA and 3rd party lab tested so I felt that it was safe to try. This person had a definite herx reaction from taking this Cryptolepis.  The Lyme literate doctor that they see felt that this was a very positive sign that the Cryptolepis was working.I decided to try this brand myself and I can definitely tell that it's stronger and making a difference. It has a 1:3 menstruum ratio vs the 1:5 ratio of Montana Farmacy.  I noticed an increase in fatigue with this brand at first as it started fighting the Lyme bacteria. Now that I've been taking it for a few weeks, I'm feeling noticeably better and more energized even with a low dose.I've also recommended this brand to a second person with Lyme Disease and other coinfections. They were taking a different Cryptolepis and they feel that Secrects of the Tribe Cryptolepis is much better than what they were taking previously.I highly recommend giving this product a try if you're considering it. Just be careful not to take too much at first because it's strong stuff. Start as slow as one drop a day if necessary based on your reaction.",

  "text": "Shame on these companies for watering down medicine.I have a debilitating, deadly illness and I have been buying this brand of cryptolepsis for a few weeks now. I have spent a good deal of money with this company.. It has been high quality medicine. This is not supposed to taste good, it's medicine.I purchased two bottles this time. One bottle was their regular high quality, bitter, highly effective product. The second bottle was watered down and I could barely taste it. I need more of this immediately otherwise I will start having seizures, difficulty breathing, lose my memory again and much more. It is very upsetting when these companies water down their products that we use as medicine.So now I am trying to figure out how to source a large amount of high quality cryptolepsis root in order to make my own tinctures. I've tried a few different brands of this tincture and they simply don't work. This brand had been the best, and I buy it because it ships quickly. I can't afford to wait a week or a week and a half.So I'm going to buy it one last time, and if the next bottle is similarly weak and watered down, and doesn't really taste that bitter, and doesn't really help my health, I give up.You guys are going to lose a loyal customer to try and what, save a few bucks?",

  "text": "I don't usually believe in this sort of product. Often feeling as though the effects the people endorsing it describe are all in their head or that they are exaggerating.I can tell you my experience. I have had some sort of congestion for several months  that wouldn't allow me to get a full breath. It felt like I was breathing through a towel most of the time. I was coughing and producing some stuff, but it never felt clear. It seemed to actually be getting worse. I'm a singer and it also put a really bad hole in my range where I could sing above and below but couldn't hit the inbetween.I received this yesterday. I was skeptical, but the reviews were so good (including from decades long smokers) so, I filled the included glass dropper to the 1ml mark as there were not instructions beyond that I could use it 3 times a day.I squirted the substance under my tounge and held it there for a 10 count before swallowing.30 min later, (I'll try not to be too graphic) but I produced a larger than usual volume by a startling amount and this happened a few more times over the next half an hour, finally culminating in a coughing fit that ended with...A breath of fresh air that felt like I had been under water and finally reached the surface. Ecstatic doesn't begin to describe my mood.I took one other dose at the end of the day. This morning I was singing with only a few minor notes that were difficult BUT NO LONGER IMPOSSIBLE to hit. I feel like those too will get better in short order simply because I haven't been able to practice them.I was hitting vibrato I couldn't dare to try yesterday...it's not a miracle. But it's far more than I ever expected much faster than i could have dreamed. 0 doubt in my mind this product works!On top of that, it actually tastes pretty good. I would have eaten cardboard to get this result, and still given it a 5 star review. So can I add a 6th star?",

  "text": "As the headline reads I have both generalized anxiety and panic disorder and I\u2019ve been dealing with it all of my life. As someone who has been on many medications over the years with often negative repercussions I\u2019m very much for the natural approach of diet, exercise, Therapy, and supplements.This is not my first herbpharm  tincture I first bought the chamomile and lemonbalm. I was already comfortable using this when I bought it I just didn\u2019t realize how amazing it was for anxiety until recently when I started having crippling panic attacks again at the end of February. As someone who took Clonopin for more than six years, and then had to spend a year withdrawing and coming off of it I have to say this tincture gives me just as much relief. Without any of the side effects of withdrawal symptoms. That\u2019s enough to be a win in my book. It\u2019s reasonably priced it lasts a fairly long time you can also buy a 4 ounce bottle which I love as an option. I\u2019ve known about this for years and like I said I\u2019ve used some of the other ones I have for sleep and for anxiety this has worked the best for me however I\u2019ve known about this for years and like I said I\u2019ve used some of the other ones I have for sleep and for anxiety this has worked the best for me however. I originally bought this one for sleep. I have since ordered it two more times. I don\u2019t actually noticed any sedative affects like some others have mentioned. Everyone is different And is affected differently so that\u2019s important to keep in mind. It sucks to see the reviews bad mouthing these herb farm products for potency and what not. Your time would be better spent making a tincture of your own at home instead of writing reviews for products that work for hundreds of other people. I\u2019m so happy I found this and it gives me hope that my anxiety and more so my panic attacks aren\u2019t going to take over my life.",

So, this is my second bottle, and I must say, I am impressed!It's not a \"cure all\" for anxiety, of course. I have chronic anxiety so I knew going in this wouldn't be a cure for that. But it has helped tremendously. It definitely takes the edge off, helps me to be able to take deeper breaths, takes the chest pain away, and makes my heart stop racing! I usually take it 1-2 times a day. With such a small bottle I try to keep it to a minimum and use it only when I really need it.It does not taste good, but I dilute it in a small sip of water and down it fast. Chase it with another sip of water, and done. It does not leave a bad aftertaste, especially when you drink water afterward.I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with any form of anxiety. Like I said, it's not a cure all, but it does take the edge off!",

  "text": "There's definitely a noticeable relaxant effect.The taste is... herbal, but not bad. I generally need a Trazadone to get me to sleep, and then I have to discipline myself into relaxing so it can work. With this, even more so than valerian, falling asleep is an eventuality more than a choice (although I used about 3x the suggested dose before I felt much).Like a lot of extracts, this has a heavy alcohol component. I put it in a glass of cheap bota box red; the flavor was very strong and herbal--I actually really enjoyed the taste but I'm a little weird about herbal flavoring in liqueur and wine, so don't trust me on that really.Bottom line, if sleep hygiene doesn't work for you, try melatonin on a strict regime. If that doesn't work, try it and Valerian. If that doesn't work, try melatonin and this.This is powerful in a normally adult way: you'll get sleepy, very sleepy. Nothing fun, just a kind of expensive alternative to waiting on insurance.If sleep I'd the goal, go forth. Otherwise? Just know this is a sleepy drug, not a party drug.",

  "text": "I was prescribed this extract by my doctor to see if it helped with my hot flashes that were completely out of control. Within 2 weeks of twice daily usage they disappeared, yippee! As a side bonus, with continued use, it also seems to have taken care of heart palpitations I used to get around 3 am.m, upon waking and randomly during the day. My doc doesnt seem to think this is a normal response, but I will take it! I used 2 droppers 2x daily to have this effect, and the 4 oz bottle lasts me about a month at this dosage.Unfortunately I did not have as good luck with it helping my insomnia. I use 2 droppers ? ~40 drops at bedtime. Maybe more would show a benefit.As a side note, the extract works much better for me than taking capsules, even if I take the capsules apart and take the powder in some water.UPDATE Dec2014 - I found if I take 6 droppers half full at bedtime it works great on my insomnia. I just tried Gaia phyto-gels caps\n  \nGaia Herbs Passion Flower Liquid Phyto-Capsules, 60 Count\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    and am up to 3 at night with no success/sleepiness, so I may need to switch back to the HerbPharma liquid here.",

  "text": "I bought this as well as the Lavander oil from herb pharm. My friend who is a naturopathic doctor recommended me to pour three squeezes of each into my water/preferred beverage- she said 4 squeezes should be the maximum amount I use though. I decided to give this product four stars because for whatever reason, it does not calm my anxiety down ALL the time. Sometimes I feel as if it made absolutely no difference, whereas other times I DEFINITELY DO feel that it\u2019s kicking in and working. That to me right there says a lot, because I have tried TONS of natural supplements before in the past to help cope with my anxiety, and NONE of them did a single thing for me & I'm not one to fall for placebos. I\u2019m very satisfied with Herb Pharm\u2019s lavander & Passion flower oils- I just wish they worked ALL the time. I feel like when I don\u2019t take it after 2-5 days they work better. However, if I\u2019m using it everyday, I don\u2019t feel like the results are as great. Either way, something is better than nothing- definitely recommend! Lol",

  "text": "My acupuncturist recommended this blend, and I was worried it might leave me \"hungover\" in the morning, because I tend to be very sensitive to such things, but it doesn't at all! I'm in a stressful season of life and was having a hard time sleeping more than 4-5 hours a night, so I would feel really \"crunchy\" during the day, and then wired-tired at night. This spray has not only helped me look forward to good sleep every night, it has also \"softened\" my nervous system so even when I'm light on sleep (due to external circumstances now rather than internal ones) I don't get that crunchy feeling. I keep it next to my bed and take it nightly (along with magnesium glycinate). It tastes great! Like cardamom.",

The suggested use is to keep it by your bed and spray without getting up. I prefer to mix it with a little water as the spray was a bit intense for my tongue. Otherwise, the formula is great! Most sleep herbs are bitter and unpleasant. This is the best I've used so far and the flavor is decent. When I'm tossing and turning and can't get to sleep or get back to sleep, this helps do the trick. Thanks, Herb Pharm! I'm happy to be supporting a \"local\" company here in Oregon.",

I have lifelong insomnia and have a closet larger than a pharmacy filled with sleep remedies from homeopathic, herbal, Chinese medicine, sprays, essential oils, and at least 15 other types of natural remedies to help me sleep. You name it -- it is in my closet.  I can get to sleep pretty well most nights without any help, but I wake up at 3:00 a.m. and then am up for the rest of the night. Doesn't matter if I hit the sack at 9:00 p.m. or 1:00 a.m.  I am up at 3:00 a.m. for the day. This was approximately my 20th try at a natural remedy for insomnia and it did not work for me. I am writing this after using it for 30 days -- every night as directed. The taste is OK for me since I am used to Chinese herbs which are horrible to taste. But this did not work -- I was up at 3:15 a.m. every night -- so maybe it gave me an extra 15 minutes before I was wide awake for the day.",

  "text": "Skullcap is amazing.  I have severe social anxiety as well as anxiety for any other situation.  I was on anti-depressants from age 15 to 21, then I had a child and didn't want to get back on prescription medication.  I make my own gel capsules using the tincture and usually take one to two depending on the severity of the situation.  This does not make me feel groggy or fatigued in anyway, but i have heard that it can in some people.  In my opinion the feeling it gives you is sort of like taking a shot of alcohol, in the way that it calms your nerves.  I recommend this to everyone but some people are hesitant because it doesn't effect you the way prescription anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication does, which is a good thing I think.  You really have to let your body \"open up\" and allow it to work to notice a difference.",

  "text": "Excellent calming agent and pain manager!!!  The quality of Herb Pharm is the BEST!!  Using this along with Crampbark by Herb Pharm, I have completely stopped using OTC pain medicine for everything.  The combination of the two can beat any pain that I've had...other than the nerve pain associated with my herniated disk.  It has worked for headaches, menstrual cramps, spastic colon/IBS...and on most of my back and joint pain.  It does not make me tired but does make me more relaxed.  The taste is not a problem.UPDATE: I have discovered Jamaica Dogwood from Herb Pharm and I highly suggest it to all pain sufferers!!! I combine it with cramp bark for severe pain. I still use the Skullcap...but more for pain when I'm trying to relax or sleep...or just to relax. Jamaica Dogwood works on all pain including nerve pain. I finally can live pain-free with my herniated disk. When I recently started to get a flair up of sciatica (caused by herniated disk), I combined it with willow bark also from Herb Pharm, which is an anti-inflammatory (not to be used with any NSAIDs), which caused my sciatica to almost completely go away in 1 hour of taking the first dose. With in 4 days of using the combination my sciatica was GONE...instead of 30 chiropractor visits and tons of physical therapy which used to take up to 4 months to heal. You gotta' love herbs!!!",

  "text": "I've spent the last several years working very high stress, technical jobs in startups. And ooohhh man does the anxiety just get worse over time. Over longer periods of stress, certain minerals in your body can be depleted, leaving you more and more anxious and stressed out. Obviously mineral replenishment and the restoration of adrenal function is your end goal, but that takes time.In the meantime, I've found that a few drops of skullcap when I've stressed out helps take the edge off. As with anything, overuse can be problematic and have side effects. But a few drops of this helps calm me temporarily. It's not going to have prescription strength powers..... but it'll be safer and have fewer side effects and issues on your overall bodily symptoms if you have milder bouts of anxiety.I also like to use this before bedtime to help calm my racing mind and get to sleep. My preference is valerian, but using that too frequently can cause it to use it's effectiveness. So I like to alternate out between skullcap and valerian, combined with hops, to actually get a good nights sleep. Enough sleep can help your body better manage your cortisol levels (created as a response to stress).  Out of balance cortisol can lead to a host of other problems, including weight gain.",

  "text": "I did quite a bit of reading/research on Skullcap, and the difference in American & Chinese. (This one is American). I started as per the directions: 1 dropper/dose, 3 times per day. I was feeling sleepy (pleasantly) too early in the day. I cut back to 2 doses per day, afternoon and evening. Still more sleepy than I wanted in the late afternoon. Now, if I'm not going out, I have 1 dropper before dinner, and 1 at bedtime. If I'm going out in the early evening for dinner or a gathering, I take only 1 dropper at bedtime. This works well for me. It definitely does feel somewhat \"sedating\", but in much more pleasant a manner than ANY pill. Plus, my favorite part is the feeling of refreshing wakefulness in the morning, no grogginess. One suggestion, I would avoid taking it at all if you have consumed any alcoholic beverages on that day.",

  "text": "This is working great for me. I have migraines and tension headaches, and also have some trouble with insomnia. This has helped on all fronts. I do not take the full dose, but only about 7 drops at night. If I have a headache in the morning, I start with 5 drops, and sometimes add a few drops of Herb Pharm's White Willow Bark. OTC painkillers have never done much for my headaches, but this takes them right away. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I take about 5 drops along with some L-theanine, and usually can go right back to sleep.I would suggest starting with just 2-3 drops and working up from there. It seems to be pretty strong stuff.",

  "text": "I have tried for 3 years to get off Ambien sleep medication. I tried cuttapering back, but it never worked. Then I read about Skullcap, bought this and the loose tea, but I have yet to try the loosetea as this is so much easier. I began taking it, without lowering my dosage. I waited a week, and then I began cutting down my pills, each time taking that dosage for a week. What I noticed the first week and it continues this way, is I feel relaxed and sleep longer. If I awake in the middle to the night with any problems, I take another dropper full, but that is seldom. Last night I got down to just scraping off just  a little of my Ambien pill, that it was just psychological that I needed it. . Finally, I realize now that I can sleep without Ambien. I will continue to buy this to have when we take trips. This product needs to be advertised more. I found out about when I got on a forum where others were trying to get off sleeping pills. I have never had such good night sleeps and days where I felt energized. I have a new life.",

  "text": "I took this for the first time last night.  What a night!  I took it to help with sleep and pain.  I will say that it most definitely made me sleepy and I did find it calming.  However, for me it appears to be dangerous.  I woke up a couple hours after taking it.  I saw lights on under the bedroom doors (one leads to a hall and one to a laundry room).  It took me a long time to figure out where I was in the room.  I knew I was in the room in the bed, but didn't know where in the room the bed was located.  I then realized that I was upside down and half-off the mattress.  Not at all like me, I don't move much.  I got up and went to the bathroom and when I came back the lights under the door were not on.  I asked my husband who was in the basement playing a computer game and he said no lights were on to his knowledge.  So I don't know what happened!  I think I was half-asleep when I got up.  I ended up sleeping until 9 this morning but I have been groggy all day.  I should note that I am very sensitive to medications so it stands to reason that I would be with herbs as well.  But after reading about some issues with Skullcap and possible liver problems, I'm going to discontinue it.  Tonight I'm trying the Jamaican Dogwood.  I'll post about that one tomorrow.  By the way, I love Herb Pharm and have not been sick all year, which I believe is due to using their Mullein Blend.  I would not hesitate to purchase that one.",

  "text": "We use more than a couple supplements. It's not always possible to know how well each is working individually when taken with others. Over the years I have learned to use the label and the ad to judge the quality of a supplement. I use not only what IS there, but also what isn't there.Pura Herba GoldensealPROS:Ingredients are organic.No fillers or chemical preservatives. (None are needed as glycerin is a preservative.)Gives a lot of info, a lot that many should but don't. Pure Herba used dried root and a menstrum ratio of 1:3. I've made extracts and I really appreciate the information.In an amber glass bottle.Extract is made in USA, and the information is on the label. No looking through a miles long ad or posting a question to find out.$15 for 85 servings is 18\u00a2 per serving.CONS:Uses the term tincture to identify this glycerite. Glycerites are made with glycerite, tinctures are made with alcohol, so when they put say it's an alcohol free tincture on the label, it's an oxymoron , a sign of either an uninformed manufacturer or the manufacturer thinking their consumer is uninformed. Both tinctures and glycerites are extracts, but the terms are not interchangeable. Call it what it is, a glycerite extract.",

  "text": "Goldenseal is a native plant of North America and has a long rich history of use by Native Americans who long understood the significance of this golden root. Rich in alkaloids mixed with flavonoids this herb is known to be antimicrobial, a natural antibiotic, anti-inflammatory and has many uses in herbal preparations. There are also concerns that due to its popularity, it is being over harvested. That being said this herb is a premier herb to have in your herbal cabinet.That being said, I can judge this bottle of Goldenseal only by the information given on the listing and on the bottle. It is said to be organic but is not certified and is prepared in the USA by Puraherba, a recently founded company out of Florida. Their website given on the bottle does not exist so it appears to be a startup working to get its products to market quickly through this site. While this lack of information raises some questions, I'm hoping that the information given about the product is accurate.",

So, over the past month I would have the biggest unexpected results was that it helped me with my menstural cycle. My cycle length is generally 28 days exact.

  "text": "The benefits of mushrooms seems to be becoming more and more popular lately. Using a tincture like this is a great way to get the benefits of mushrooms, such as improving the immune system, sleep quality and stress response. They're easy to take; just a few drops under the tongue or in a small amount of water or other drink. However, tinctures are not known for tasting good. They're usually very UNpleasant. But I find putting the drops under the tongue prevents the taste from being too unpleasant. It also allows it to go straight into the bloodstream. I started off with a lower dose than recommended to be sure I didn't have any reaction to it. And gradually increased to the full recommended dose.  I've been taking a few tinctures and have found them to be beneficial. This is also made by a small Canadian company which I'm happy to support.",

  "text": "I have been reading some research on Reishi Mushroom for a while, and there are supposedly a ton of benefits, including cardiovascular benefits and antidepressant properties. I decided to try the liquid and this particular Tincture (mixed with a little alcohol). It's easy to administer, the package says 4 drops a day (or 4 ml), which means this bottle should last 15 days.  However, in the product description, it says to use 2 drops, which means the bottle will last 30 days. Based on my research, I suggest going with 1 or 2 drops a day so that one can analyze if there are any side effects and act accordingly. Once you assess the situation you can probably increase the dosage (or even stop it completely). I'm starting with 2 drops personally and am interested to see if it will affect blood sugar and cholesterol/triglycerides.I didn't taste the drops on their own, but I added them to my tea, I didn't notice any change in taste, though again I'm using 2 drops, so I'm not sure if there will be a difference if one uses 4 drops. You can also add it to food, like a salad, though you probably need to make sure that you eat all the salad serving to make sure you take the dose that you are on. I have high hopes for this product and will continue to consume it for 3 months and go for blood work to see if there are any benefits in the area I discussed above. Though there are other benefits as described in the product description, that I will keep my eye on as well.",

  "text": "I love products made in Canada and even better when they come in a glass bottle. Includes a dropper (instead of a cap) and measurements up to 1ml so it is very easy to use and get the correct dosage. I'm a firm believer in natural products and using nature to not only sustain us but to repair us as well.It tastes surprisingly pleasant and while I add it to my morning coffee I wanted to know what the actual taste was on it's own and I'm happy to say it's tasty as well as a very light translucent golden colour. Adding it to my morning coffee the taste gets lost so I really don't notice its there.Promotes Better Immune System (which we all want) and Stress Response for a natural calm which in the busy season is a sure blessing! A win win in my book.I'm a little confused as to the dosage as the description says to take 2 dropper full's and each dropper holds 1ml so that would be 2ml. Yet the box it comes in says to take 4ml per adult dosage. And the bottle itself mentions a 4ml serving? So if I take 4ml per serving I would only get 15 servings per bottle. By taking 2ml per serving I will get 30 servings per bottle and if I only want to take 1ml per serving which for me seems reasonable I will get 60 servings so a 2 months supply. Anyhow which ever serving size you prefer to take I believe it will be helpful.I have a strong and healthy immune system as but the stress response for a natural calm is good as my husband says I'm grumpy before I get my coffee and as it goes in my coffee it's a win for both of us. I'm not so young anymore and finding something like this to help keep me calm, relaxed and healthy is great! Love it!Only time will tell as to the overall effect this will have on me and everything responds differently to different folks. But I've always felt mushrooms were good for me and to get the goodness in this tincture which is much more concentrated is wonderful!",

  "text": "I really love this brand, they\u2019re doing things right!  I can completely recommend the Forage brand and their tinctures, particularly the Lion's Mane and Reishi variants. If you read up about them on their site, you\u2019ll see why and what I mean. The origin story and their work is awesome. Reishi in particular has an incredible history that\u2019s worth reading up on. You can\u2019t say too much about health benefits on sites in general, but if you take a look at it\u2019s main uses, I feel this has been working to help things for me. I feel it has an ever so slightly minty taste to it. Main thing to know, don\u2019t waste your money on any mushroom supplement if it doesn\u2019t clearly specify it\u2019s made of  fruiting bodies, and talks about beta glucans. I also don\u2019t bother with supplements unless there\u2019s an NPN number. Forage covers both of those angles. I also love the brown sunlight protected bottle, and the easy to read dropper.So.. yup! This is a great brand! Give em a try.",

I think that it is worth a shot at trying this to get better sleep compared to taking melatonin but the overall efficacy is hard to say if it actually works. I think it is pretty anecdotal. At first, I think the placebo effect took precedent and I thought it worked well. Once that wore off, it felt as if I was just going to bed normally.\u2705 Pros \u2705- Glass bottled- Made in Canada- Does not taste terrible and can be mixed with other drinks or food\u274c Cons \u274c- I can't comment on the efficacy as it seems to have worn off or been an effect of the placebo",

I have several liquid supplements that come in similar bottles yet I have NEVER had one break. I am not overly rough opening them nor am I so strong there is justification for this to happen. I thought it was a fluke with the 1st bottle so I ordered it again, but when the exact same thing happened again, I knew I need to find a new brand for my lemon balm. The taste is actually not too bad and I didn't mind the product otherwise, though I never really felt a huge amount of calm come to me after using this.

  "text": "I loved this product the first time I bought it. The taste was pleasant and sweet, and the effects were relaxing. I purchased again and the second bottle was the same. Then I ordered a third bottle. When it arrived, sealed in its package like the others, I opened it and tried a dropperful. I nearly threw up. It tasted horribly rotten. Like drinking the juices from the bottom of a trash can. I gagged for several minutes and returned it immediately. However, I liked the first bottle so much I decided to try again. So I re-ordered and received another brand new, sealed bottle like the last. Guess what? Same horrible rotten taste. This time I did an exchange, and wrote the seller a note mentioning the horrible taste, and telling them I would not re-order a third time. Lo and behold, the next bottle I received was perfectly fine, just like the first two, with a pleasant sweet taste and calming effect. Thank goodness. All was well, until I finished that bottle and ordered the next one. Once again, I received a rotten bottle. I nearly threw up after half a dropper. It took hours to get the taste out of my mouth.  There were no odd or extenuating circumstances - the packages were well wrapped and safe, undamaged and not left in the sun. All three deliveries were in the fall/winter when temperatures were in the 60s or lower. There was no chance it went bad during transit. There is a huge batch of rotten product sitting in a warehouse somewhere, and they\u2019re just shipping it out. Probably figuring most people won\u2019t bother to return it. So far a I\u2019ve had three bad bottles out of six. If you\u2019re willing to take those odds, by all means order this product. You\u2019ve got a 50% chance of having a very nice experience. Just be ready with a bucket when you have your first taste, in case the coin toss comes up heads and you vomit your guts out instead.",

Deep Sleep addresses this some but by itself is not effective for me in that I wake up early still but maybe an hour later than I have (after I have become tolerant to other prescription meds I have been trying.)  If you try it, know that the first couple nights will be very strange, with crazy dreams - this is the best I can describe it. But at least this is not an additive medication. I have since added back the other prescriptions meds one by one and Deep Sleep does seem to potentiate their effect. I have reordered another value-size four ounce bottle from Amazon. It is not the alcohol-free version but that does not bother me and Herbs Etc tells me that the amount of alcohol in the whole bottle does not equal a half glass of wine, if I remember correctly. You might want to check with them directly to be sure, if that is an issue for you.",

I took two of these droppers half-full and slept soundly. Doing so seems to use a greater amount than in the gels, obviously, to achieve the same effect of three gels.Once I'm finished with this review, and even though I have an almost full 4oz bottle left, I'm ordering the gels again. Less mess, no aftertaste, no burping it up to haunt you three hours later, and a better value.PLEEEASE, Herbs Etc., at least add a little pina colada taste to it to make it more palatable.",

I sleep more soundly and wake up feeling more rested than I have in years, even without getting adequate hours of sleep.

  "text": "I love the choice of ingredients and the fact that it\u2019s certified organic too. It\u2019s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it\u2019s hard for me to get a \u201cfull\u201d dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there\u2019s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don\u2019t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally \u2014 the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don\u2019t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I\u2019d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I\u2019ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it\u2019s such a strange combination of flavors I\u2019m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.  In a pinch I would use this but I think I\u2019d prefer a pill or just a simple elderberry gummy instead.  Just my preference anyway.  Otherwise the product itself is clean and seems to be an excellent way to boost your immune system when necessary.",

  "text": "This item is a 30ml amber bottle of organic herb tincture that is plant based and formulated to provide immunity support. The bottle includes an eye dropper cap that is used to deliver the recommended 2 dropper full of the liquid. The ingredients includes extracts of echinacea, elderberry, thyme, sage, yarrow, and lemon balm in a proprietary combination. The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity. The liquid tastes quite bad so I recommend adding the 2 dropper full to some juice. I appreciate that it's made in the USA. I find the price point for 20 days supply to be rather steep. Overall, it's not a bad tincture to add to your daily supplement regiment, but it's not something I will continue to use given I have other more cost effective immunity support supplements.",

  "text": "The dropper on this seems to not want to fill and is very finicky to use. I see other reviewers experienced something similar, so it doesn't appear to be a fluke with my bottle. The formula appears to be effective, but I think it's kind of pricey for what it is.",

  "text": "Not entirely sure how great of a benefit one gets from the Qat listed here instead of the actual qat used in places like Yemen, but this stuff does not have any acute effects that you will notice immediately. Most importantly, if you're very sensitive to taste, this is definitely one of those \"acquired tastes\" products, but I generally liked it and thought it was pleasant enough after the initial use. Might have benefits over time, but hard to tell.",
