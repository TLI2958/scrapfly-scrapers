  "text": "I researched California Poppy in regard to anxiety and trouble sleeping. I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier. I gave some to my husband to try and he had a crazy dream that left him rattled, so it's probably not for everyone but for me it works.",

  "text": "I have used this as sleep enhancing remedy for several months and find it quite effective. I tried Californai Poppy capsules and they do not do the job. I take one dropper full  of this extract in a cup of chamomile tea about an hour before sleep. Straight chamomile does nothing. The poppy  seems to help me wake up on time and be more alert, not over sleep, so it may be helping the quality of  sleep. I dislike the high alcohol level and the taste is truly vile, that is the reason for four stars. Herb Pharm has proved to be a reliable company of quality extracts but they don't make California Poppy in a glycerin, non alcohol form. I still recommend this and suggest putting it in an herb tea to avoid the taste.",

  "text": "I have a very high tolerance for benzodiazepines from years of being prescribed for insomnia, so I researched my problem and landed on studies of  Eschscholzia californica.  As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are \"Alcohol 62%\" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.  THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSUMING BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT.",

I switched over to the California Poppy after doing some reading - I had fantastic results right away. It is a bit strong on it's own as far as flavor. I was waiting for about 45 mins with the CBD oil to feel the calming - the CA Poppy was within 10 mins. I found that my sleep was much deeper as well with the CA poppy. I have not used it for pain as of yet - just sleep. My Son was using Melatonin and I asked him to try this. He also said his sleep was deeper with CA Poppy and he did not feel groggy the next day. Also his anxiety has calmed down as well. I would recommend this for anyone  looking for better sleep and something to give a relaxing state, not for pain relief.",

  "text": "I first heard of California Poppy for pain in 2012 when a segment on Dr. Oz discussed this item.  But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.  They are NOT like a drugs related to poppy flowers (heroin).  They have not shown up during urine drug testing at work.",

My advice is to order outside of amazon a broad spectrum cbd oil or tincture I encourage contacting a local dispensary or online delivery service.  I should listen to my own advice more and will because this isn't returnable nor refundable that's a big chunk  of change I don't anymore.  So read small print and order BROAD SPECTRUM CBD.

The other day I was cooking up a storm and had been in the kitchen for hours, my feet and back were hurting. I took a couple of these babies and before I knew it the foot pain was gone, I felt good enough to go for an hour and a half drive and visit with my daughter (she was up late settling into her own place). Mind you I didn't get back home till 2 o'clock in the morning and I felt pretty good pain wise. That was my first time taking this supplement, now I usually take 2 or 3 at a time- once or twice a day- depending on how bad I feel, I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I saw that the Medical Medium has a California poppy seed shock therapy in his new Brain Protocols book and will give that a try soon.",

However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep. So don't be surprised if you sleep longer than normal.~The Rebecca Review",

  "text": "At first, I thought this product was working well. California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called \u201cglutamate\u201d which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don\u2019t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you\u2019re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I\u2019ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",

When I first tried this product, I experienced much more pronounced effects including better sleep and feeling relaxed and in a good mood when I woke up. This effect seemed to subside to some extent as I continue to take it, but it still seems more powerful than most of the other brands I've tried.",

  "text": "I tried this for as-needed calming (rather than taking daily). First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I\u2019m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems. It may help if you\u2019re too wound up to sleep.",

  "text": "This was the first California Poppy supplement I took.  I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.",

  "text": "This product is absolutely amazing. Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",

  "text": "I ordered California Poppy and Valerian. I got straight Valerian, no poppy at all. And Valerian smells so bad, like the worst dog breath ever! I will try to return it for the correct one.Update: I returned the mismarked product and reordered. I got the right one the second time. It also smells bad, but the taste is sweet and floral.  How is that even possible? I have no idea. I take 100ml before bed, rather than the recommeded 70ml.  It does seem to help me relax and get to sleep more easily.  I do not take it for pain. But it seems to help a little with anxiety if I take it as recommended (70ml) during the day. I will probably buy iy again.",

  "text": "I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night. Both poppy extract and a few bong loads of wild lettuce have proved to be effective for my occasional sleep or minor pain problems.",

  "text": "There are many products available which induce sleep in a variety of ways. The type of sleep also varies, as sleep comes at several different levels. Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste. So this California Poppy extract would be effective for occasional sleepless nights. I cannot offer an opinion about long term results.",

I am never used poppy before so I don\u2019t know exactly how I should use it and wish they provided better direction.  It doesn\u2019t say to use it before bed and doesn\u2019t warn about using it while driving or doing other things that require your attention.  I am taking one in the morning and it is too soon to see if I feel more relaxed during the day or sleep better.  I put a photo against another bottle to show that it comes in a bottle about half the size of other bottles.  I applaud the company for this as too often you get a lot of unnecessary packaging and this company seems to be sensitive to that issue.",

  "text": "As a practicing herbalist for many years (for personal use, not as a professional) and an advocate holistic practices I've found that Gaia herbs has always had quality products and I was happy to find this one available here on Subscribe and Save.  My family has been taking both formulas of the Black Elderberry syrup (the standard version and the Nighttime) as a supplements throughout the cold and flu season with excellent results.It's concentrated. You take one teaspoonful once a day, twice only if needed. I've found that it's not overly sedative which is a plus.  It has something of a mild relaxing effect keeping in mind that your mileage may vary.  The potency of the formula is focused in the immunity support that the Black Elderberries provide. It's manufactured in Italy where it's a traditional medicine with these additional organic ingredients:  Acerola, California Poppy, Lemon Balm, Grindelia, Sugar Cane (4g of sugar per serving), water, and Lemon Juice. I've come to really like this product and will be sure to keep a bottle of each formula on hand all year round, so I recommend it highly.",

My brain is so active that I can \"worry myself awake\". Very frustrating!The tried-and-true supplement I rely on is RidgeCrest Herbs DreamOn Zen formula. I take TWO doses because of my mind's ability to bust through the herbs and think myself awake anyway.BUT with this, I took two doses and slept very very soundly through the night AND morning! Yay! And I have vivid long dreams which I LOVE.The only potential negative, which I do not care about and do not personally consider to be negative, is that compared to the DreamOn Zen, it doesn't help me fall asleep. I don't have issues falling asleep, but I do notice now that something about DreamOn Zen helped make me feel sleepier and go to sleep faster.My new plan is to take one dose of this plus one dose of DreamOn Zen instead of two doses of either one separately.So if your brain situation sounds like mine, try this. And honestly I also highly recommend trying DreamOn Zen too.",

After trying their product and finding that it did nothing for me, even after more than doubling the recommended dosage I tried to return it and ended on a chat that supposedly approved my return, but could not tell me where to mail the product. It told me to use the rerun address in my confirmation email, but there was no return address in said email. Then I was directed to call the customer service line, but when I did what I got was a recoded message selling me new products and subscriptions. And though I said I wasn\u2019t interested I was transferred to said promotions, since it was a non interactive recording, which transferred to the promotional line regardless of my response. There was no life person to talk to. In other words I got approval to return, but was given zero directions or guidance on how to make said return.I call that a scam.",

  "text": "This seed mix is described as California Native plants but when seeded it contains mostly non-native species (flower bed dominated by Calendula officinalis, Lobularia maritima (sweet Alyssum), and Cynoglossum amabile (Chinese forget-me-not), with some Centaurea cyanus (cornflower), Consolida ajacis (doubtful knight's spur), and common poppy. Of 8 species the only 2 native species are California poppy (many seeds) and Clarkia unguiculata (very few seeds). This is especially bad when you have a garden with otherwise only native plants since many of these species are spreading very easily (and have become introduced in many places in North America).",
