As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.  THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CONSUMING BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+Foxie2+L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XpLXIi24L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KD-oBo6jS._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NPeBahFnS._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jU6e3a-8S._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41HLpfDdNeL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4153WRGqymS._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Sxq6JBEDS._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rkjoWyc6L._AC_.jpg

I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain.

As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal.

I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain.

I wanted to try the extra strength version that the store didn't carry and decided to get the variety pack here. I'll return with my thoughts on each flavor as I try them but wanted to go ahead and leave my feedback because I've loved my experience so far.üåôNighty Night: A very full tea with a delicious and refreshing minty lilt. Drinking this tea is one of the few things I look forward to eveyday and while it doesn't have a sleepy affect it does work well to calm my nerves before bed.üí§Nighty Night Extra: Very similar to Nighty Night but also contains valerian root. Valerian root has a very distinct and rather unpleasant smell but it's flavor isn't unpleasant, it reminds me of dandelion tea. Extra had a bit more body than regular Nighty Night and had the same affect on my sleepiness.üçÉLavender mint: This makes me feel like I'm drinking camomile tea. The distinctive floral taste of lavender coupled with refreshing mint is absolutely glorious. Perfect balance of flavors where the lavender is not too flowery, the mint not too electric‚Ä¶ overall a very smoothing experience üòåüßòCamomile Lavender: Unlike the Lavender Mint the Lavender is a bit too overpowering for the camomile. For me, it's a bit too flowery and bitter in a way I can only balance with another less floral tea. Ideally I'd use another camomile but I didn't have any so I used the Nighty Night and while the Lavender is still very strong it's less biting.ü´ñCinnamon: I'll be honest, I was NOT looking forward to trying this one. While I love a spicy ginger tea, cinnamon ain my thing ùì±ùì∏ùîÄùìÆùìøùìÆùìª, I paired it with a generous splash of banana pudding whisky, strawberry gin, a spoonful of jujubes in honey tea and it was absolutely heavenly, buttery even. The cinnamon alone is actually rather pleasant, I was expecting it to be overpowering but it's not at all, more of a twange than in your face. It can actually lean fruity if you want it to, maybe throw in some lemon juice or peach tea. It could also go floral but I went the more cakey route and think this would be great to deepen the flavor profile of a butter beer or hot cocoa. Though it stands it's own it's definitely a more subdued tea than the others.üçãLemon balm: Though lemon balm is part of the mint family it's definitely more citrusy in flavor than minty. It does however have a slightly minty aftertaste that's closest to spearmint in flavor and is easier to detect if you exhale through your nose between sips. This is the mildest of the tea flavors in this variety pack though it absolutely does have its own charm the slight lemony taste of this tea had me craving more. It tastes very much like lemon zest so while it's distinctly lemony tasting it's not super tangy. I decided to add a bag of lemon ginger tea with a couple splashes of lime to deepen and round out the perfectly cirtusy experience.To sum everything up my favorite was definitely the Lavender Mint with Nighty Night coming in at a very close second. If you're having issues with insomnia these teas unfortunately are not the answer but they are certainly useful in setting the stage for a restful night's sleep which is a fundamental part of good sleep hygiene. I personally have found cbn and indica gummies to be very useful and will mix them in my tea to amplify the calming affect of the tea and the sleepy affect of the gummies in this oddly perfect synergy that has my eyelids drooping before I can even finish the cup. I hope my review was helpful, happy steeping üòå",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Glp1DIwXL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FgO7tZ3pL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zlN3CEcpL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51e-PWsErTL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wi896n3RL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51TUS3szleL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514q8c4edAL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GxKwbXeIL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51wMKsloTSL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514q8c4edAL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wi896n3RL.jpg

Now it's not an immediate thing so be patient and use caution and DON'T do what I did.I had me a nice cuppa wen it came and waited several hours (5? 6?) and nothing had happened yet. I thought, maybe I brewed it too weak. So I made a second cup before I laid down to sleep. I slept about 3 hours and woke up to intense pain and the need to GO!I raced to the bathroom and it was not like other over the counter laxatives that makes things watery and loose. Nooo, this was solid and urgent and painful and I felt heat wash over me and like I was going to throw up at the same time. Almost as if I had food poisoning kind of feeling. I remember closing my eyes once I had some relief (after I'd been sweating because of it and not from strain, no no... one does not strain and push too hard or else you have other problems to deal with). The next thing I know I am half-way waking up and not sure where I was or how I got there or what day it was.I had fainted somehow. Passed out cold and fallen off the toilet over beside it wedged between the toilet and the sink cabinet. Even after finally deducing where I was you would think I would try to get up. No. I couldn't. I was utterly without energy and strength and felt drugged. I don't think my eyes even completely opened. I fell back to 'sleep' there for who knows how long since I was at home alone. When I finally could wake and move I had to 'go' again and feared passing out, again. Luckily I didn't. Once business was handled on the toilet I got a shower and laid down for a few more hours and was woken with pains again.No passing out this time and it wasn't as painful but there was still discomfort. Stool was more loose and liquid this time but briefer. And so it's been off and on all night/morning for me.Moral of the story....Drink one or even only half a cup the first time and wait... WAIT! Even if you have to wait overnight, for the love of all that's holy wait. Otherwise you too might feel like you are dying and end up passed out in your bathroom floor. it does what it says it does. It cleans you out but be patient with that process or suffer the consequences.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mDEm7pZzL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ZIF7hVFgL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CbKgbAcNL.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21aJrSfadUL.jpg

(Note - This Is Not For Pain)",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015",True,"I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OtQndo79L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/316CMENJCPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BtWrlD+sL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xEFBKeZML._AC_.jpg

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night.

This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste.

But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.

I have never had this problem when I buy it in stores though, so definitely a shipping issue.

First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I‚Äôm not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems.

I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KIbPz5ZJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tiyTvNPmL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OTX-E2AfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t+QesskGL._AC_.jpg

California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called ‚Äúglutamate‚Äù which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don‚Äôt feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you‚Äôre increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I‚Äôve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ErE1fXrhL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aN0fnenFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ta4W-IuKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AnYHzeOSL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+QNhdArQL._AC_.jpg

Normally, I‚Äôd tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different‚Äîa bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I‚Äôd heard these were supposed to be nature‚Äôs way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn‚Äôt paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity‚Äîwho knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I‚Äôd hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn‚Äôt feel groggy or out of it‚Äîjust calm, focused, and oddly energized.

I was kind of just looking for something to help relieve the symptoms in conjunction with the other preventative treatments. This tea contains peppermint, which is good to relieve an unhappy stomach. I can say that it does help a little to soothe the irritation and other stuff. But it isn't some kind of miracle elixer. One of the reasons I bought this was because lots of reviews said that it tasted great. That's just not true. I drink lots of teas. Being that my Wife is from China, I keep many different varieties at my house. This tastes far worse than any Ive had. It also leaves a very powerful aftertaste that doesnt go away easily. No big deal, we arent drinking this for pleasure. I just wanted to set the record straight on the flavor issue. The price is also very outrageous.

At first sip, the blend of sarsaparilla root and other flavors did remind me of the nostalgic beverage, offering a unique twist on my usual tea routine.The flavor profile is interesting, marrying the earthy notes of herbal tea with the distinct, slightly sweet essence of root beer. It's a novel concept that captures the essence of the soda without the fizz, making it a cozy, caffeine-free alternative for evenings.However, the price tag gave me pause. It's on the higher end for tea, which might make one reconsider its value, especially if you're an avid tea drinker looking for a daily staple. While the novelty and taste are commendable, the cost factor could be a deterrent for those on a budget or for whom tea is a frequent indulgence.In conclusion, Nelson's Tea Really Root Beer is a fun, flavorful experiment for those looking to spice up their tea collection.

This is my latest of 4 that I use, and it immediately became my favorite. The scent is rich and reminds me of Tiramisu. As it's cooling, I sit and breathe it in. The taste is the same and sweet enough, but sometimes I add a teaspoon of local honey.It helps me fall asleep easier. I also alternate several different forms of Melatonin (patch, liposomal, compound and sublingual) and some other natural supplements along with the teas. All in all, they're not perfect, but they make my nights restful, even if I don't sleep like a log straight through. I've done all the recommended things for getting restful sleep, including dark room, sleeping away from electrical outlets, early supper, and I don't drink coffee, tea or use refined sugars or gluten. So yes, I'm trying, and this tea makes it all a little easier. I'm at a stage in my life where I have to accept that my nights of falling into bed, going out like a light and sleeping 8 or 9 hours are past. I've read a few books on insomnia, and it helps to know that our ideal sleep schedule is a modern invention. People used to go to bed when the sun went down, sleep for 3 or 4 hours, get up and putter around, maybe even visit neighbors, then go back to bed and sleep till sunrise. It helps is you don't think of periodic wakefulness as a handicap. On the nights when I simply can't lie in bed, I get up, accompanied by my shih tzu, and pile up on the sofa with my iPad or watch TV for a couple of hours, then go back to bed when I'm sleepy.Thank you, Yogi, for your healthy, soothing teas.

I have it every morning, and I'm definitely more alert and productive with it. No crash later on in the day. However, if I don't have it, I do get a massive headache. It says 'no headache', but I get the headache w/out it (just no crash the same day). Probably addicted to caffeine, but I didn‚Äôt have this problem before with just straight black tea.  And it's really expensive for tea, but I'm so energized and productive with it - I really like it. It's pepperminty-flavor. I had been doing straight black tea for years, but this is definitely better. I try some days to go back to black tea, and it's nice, but doesn't quite have the pick-me-up that this does. I add a little honey to it for sweetness. Yum! The price is a real drawback, but it's quality tea. If you purchase directly on website instead, you can subscribe and purchase more at a time (e.g. 60 bags every 2 months) and it's cheaper. I definitely use my subscription! Still love it. Update: Oh no! They're out of stock! I have tried in vain to find a good replacement (end up mixing mint and black tea...not the same...at all). Soooo sad! This is really the best tea out there.

Finally, I was able to get a good nights rest after months!Initially, the scent of the bag itself is nice. It has a good, comforting aroma. However once you let the tea diffuse for around 8 minutes, it's different. The once comforting aroma is pungent and makes you wrinkle your nose. The taste itself is so bad, sour and unappetizing that you'll only be able to take a sip or two at a time, lest you risk an upset stomach.

I have been under a lot of stress lately, and this tea has definitely helped me get to sleep.  I have been drinking it for about a month now as needed.  I feel like I sleep a bit more deeply when I drink this, which I have attributed to being more relaxed at bedtime.  It is not a miracle, but I think that the tea itself along with the routine of having it before bed really helps me to relax.Make sure you steep it as directed for 10-15minutes.  I have noticed that if I do not cover my cup to keep the heat in the tea does not come out as strong.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because the flavor is not my favorite.  Its nice for sure, but a bit mild for me.  It is a better and more complex flavor than any other nighttime relaxation tea I have tried.  I prefer to either make a strong cup or sometimes I steep it with a bag of chamomile tea as well which makes a very nice flavor.

As you can imagine, it has a floral scent/taste, which is very relaxing and soothing but might not be to everyone's taste. It is caffeine-free. It suggests on the back to use it with a filter bag, but I used it in a regular tea strainer with no issues. The leaves are large enough that I didn't get sediment in my tea.It is quite expensive but a large bag, considering you only need one heaped teaspoon for 8oz of water. There are an estimated 33 cups in the bag, so it is slightly less than a dollar a cup, but that's still more expensive than some other teas I've tried that come in at less than fifty cents per cup.The scent is quite strong and looks quite pretty, so if you don't want to drink this as tea, you could use it for potpourri.

The other pitcher has another tea from this manufacturer.This tea has a strong ginger taste, which probably is why it comes first in the name, lol! I'm used to ones that are peach first, then ginger, which isn't as strong. It's okay with me, but I'm glad I didn't add some fresh ginger pieces to it when it was brewing! I like to add frozen fruit to my tea when drinking it, to keep it cold, and add a little flavor.The first picture is of the dry tea before it is brewed, straight out of the packet. You can see big chunks of fruit in there, with other spices and tea. The aroma is magical.The second picture is the tea after it's been brewed.

They source THE BEST from around the world. This chamomile brews THE MOST AMAZING and satisfying elixir. I noticed the Egyptian source was replaced with another region but the quality remains superb. Unfortunately, Amazon does not understand the care required to protect the dried whole flowers during delivery and they put it in a plastic sleeve without even the slightest cushion. The result was a badly crushed product. Rishi packs their direct orders properly so Amazon needs to catch up in this area Most people wouldn't care but if I wanted dust, I would have ordered it. I ordered whole flowers and now I have to put them in paper filters to prevent the crushed bits from ending up in my cup...I don't like the taste of paper, I'm spoiled, I know. I tried my microperforated filter but it wasn't enough. But it doesn't stop me from enjoying this Superior product. I just might order direct next time if Amazon can't correct their poor handling.

But this is even better! Open opening the package, immediately you can smell the freshness of the leaves. As this was my first time using loose leaf tea, it was fun just gently inhaling the scent, taking a moment to identify and appreciate each of the ingredients.Usually I can't wait for the bags to steep but this time I gave the leaves the appropriate amount of time, the recommended 4 minutes, excited to experience each flavor. While my cup usually has a generous helping of sugar and milk, this time I only added a splash to cool it down, and a small teaspoon. It did not disappoint. The flavors came together beautifully, without the usual bitterness that requires all the sugar to make it enjoyable for me. This time, I actually enjoyed the flavor of the tea itself, savoring each sip.Not only was the sup itself wonderful, but the packaging is aesthetically pleasing. Tightly pressed so no air gets inside keeping leaves fresh.The seller also included a complimentary sample of another flavor. I anticipate getting at least 3 or 4 cups from the sample alone!I highly recommend this tea, this seller, and will definitely be purchasing again.Thank you so much!EDIT- Even though the bag doesnt look like much at first, it goes a long way!We've had this bag for 2 weeks now, and had probably 10 cups worth.  We haven't even gone through a quarter of it. We used to have to use two bags of the pre bagged tea for each cup, so even though there were 20 bags, we would only get 10 cups out of it, and it's about $5 at our local store. This loose leaf not only taste so much better but it you end up getting more bang for your buck!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41oUxhtwNrL.jpg

My asthma is caused by inflammation to the airways and thyme is touted as possibly being beneficial for inflammation and soothing a throat irritated by coughing. So, hey, anything that might help I'll at least give it a try.  It does have a pleasant herbal taste, at least in my opinion, and is soothing on my throat. Since it is an herbal tea I can drink it anytime of day or even in the evening and not have to worry about caffeine disturbing my sleep. I can usually get two cups of tea from one teabag so for my personal use it lasts me awhile. I purchased this thyme tea online because I could not find it in any of my local stores. I would purchase it again as it would be good for allergy season as well when I get the sneezing and coughing spells from allergen irritants. Plus it just makes a nice warm soothing nightcap too.I have low blood pressure and am not on medication so I don't worry too much about  the thyme tea raising my blood pressure but those on blood pressure medication might want to take caution.

I am not exaggerating one bit.I'm 71 years old with lots of allergies - to foods and environmental vegetation.In July there was a huge wildfire in the mountains near us.  I felt like I was hit with a ton of bricks.  The wildfire smoke wreaked havoc on my body.  My face swelled up badly.  I had difficulty breathing.  My blood pressure went up 21 points and stayed that way for 6 weeks.  I went to my primary care doctor and urgent care during this time.  I was a mess.Then I learned that the fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke settles in the lungs, gets into the bloodstream and can cross the blood-brain barrier.  I was on high doses of prednisone for 6 weeks.  I didn't get better.I finally learned that thyme tea is an anti-inflammatory. So, I bought some from Amazon.  I flavored it with cinnamon, ginger, a pinch of cloves and a little honey.  It tasted good.  After just half a cup, I started to feel better - finally.  After an hour, I was starting to feel 'healthy'.Now, after 3 days, my neighbors and friends are telling me that the swelling on my face is getting better.  When it's so noticeable that even casual neighbors are noticing the difference, you know something good is happening.  And, I just checked my blood pressure.  It's down by 15 points.This tea is really healing me.  And, a friend who is a chef dropped by and I asked him to taste the tea.  After 3 sips, he said that the tightness he had in his chest went away.  I wasn't even aware that he was having chest problems.  He said he hasn't been bothered by asthma in a long time, but that day his chest felt tight.  The tea helped him to feel better.These are true stories.  Take it for what you will.
