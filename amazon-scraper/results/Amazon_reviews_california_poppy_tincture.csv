As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal.

California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called “glutamate” which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don’t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you’re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I’ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ErE1fXrhL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aN0fnenFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ta4W-IuKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AnYHzeOSL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+QNhdArQL._AC_.jpg

(Note - This Is Not For Pain)",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015",True,"I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body.

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night.

The type of sleep also varies, as sleep comes at several different levels. Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste. So this California Poppy extract would be effective for occasional sleepless nights.

Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FLWNq2vUL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bNmU4CB5L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mglMM3cvL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Zi+yKEzWS._AC_.jpg

But it was hard to find ... and the stores only had it in liquid tincture form.  (Yuck!)  Forgot about the product for years, until I saw this during a LIGHTENING DEAL ... so I grabbed a bottle.  After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.  I have no day drowsiness, yet they help me fall asleep faster, along with melatonin.  Most allopathic Doctors know nothing about California Poppyseed supplements.

Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I’m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason.

I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.

Normally, I’d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different—a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I’d heard these were supposed to be nature’s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn’t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity—who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I’m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I’d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend.

I tried a tad bit plain just to see. I did mix the vial dose in my tea and it was actually kind of a nice  subtle addition to sweeten it up. The tea I used is Celestial brand, Bengal Spice. Will be perfect if you like cinnamon and ginger. And I do already feel the calming effects of it.

Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don’t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I’m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I’ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I’m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there’s still some energy to spare. I’m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It’s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I’m often working double shifts a day and I’m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it’s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I’m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I’ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41mHIWyk-lL._AC_.jpg

A few months ago it was a lifesaver. So much so that I spent $100+ this time around to get two 4 oz Red Root tinctures and two 4oz Astragalus tinctures. I overlooked the first mishap during my first reorder when they sent me two glycerine-based Red Root tinctures instead of the alcohol-based tinctures I had ordered. But the second mishap is irredeemable, as I have been sent an unusable product with diluted health benefits.I was suspicious when I opened the Astragalus (first time ordering), since it was much lighter and strikingly clearer than past Astragalus tinctures I have taken. It also did not have that signature, and unmistakable, Astragalus scent. However, when I opened the Red Root, my heart sank, because I knew then the worthlessness of what I'd received. When I first ordered this product, the Red Root was a vibrant deep, rich red color and an extremely strong extraction. Now, it is indistinguishable from water...even the ""alcohol"" content appears to be much less than the bottle states, as the taste is more watery than anything else--certainly a far cry from what I'd first ordered. I've uploaded a photo of what the new tincture alongside the little bit I have left of the glycerine-based tincture (photos taken in the same place at the same time of day). There is zero chance that it holds anything close to the amount of plant material it claims to hold on the bottle. And the health benefits I've received from this new batch are zero to none, which is the hardest part to face about this. These are trying times, and to be fleeced like this in the middle of a pandemic when I cannot afford to simply purchase another bottle from a more reputable company, only twists the knife in more. Sadly, I can no longer trust this company, and I would urge others to stay away until this shady business practice has been resolved.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41iidemmJNL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QkosbwiOL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51MqmRqqbyL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511FL6974oL._AC_.jpg

My anxiety is getting better because I’m finally learning to cope through the situational anxiety, however, even when I’m not faced with those situations my anxiety arises. I’m easily startled, my heart jumps, and it’s just something I’ve learned to live with without benzos. I’m on an antidepressant that was given to help with the anxiety. Does it help? I don’t think so because I still have pretty bad anxiety. I tried every herb and natural remedy you can think of. Finally, I found a CBD tincture that contained lavender oil. For the first time ever, it soothed my anxiety just like a benzo. I was amazed because cbd never worked for me. After some homeopathic experimentation I’ve found that it was the lavender oil ( not cbd) that made me feel anxiety free.

My friend who is a naturopathic doctor recommended me to pour three squeezes of each into my water/preferred beverage- she said 4 squeezes should be the maximum amount I use though. I decided to give this product four stars because for whatever reason, it does not calm my anxiety down ALL the time. Sometimes I feel as if it made absolutely no difference, whereas other times I DEFINITELY DO feel that it’s kicking in and working. That to me right there says a lot, because I have tried TONS of natural supplements before in the past to help cope with my anxiety, and NONE of them did a single thing for me & I'm not one to fall for placebos. I’m very satisfied with Herb Pharm’s lavander & Passion flower oils- I just wish they worked ALL the time. I feel like when I don’t take it after 2-5 days they work better. However, if I’m using it everyday, I don’t feel like the results are as great. Either way, something is better than nothing- definitely recommend!

I was not aware that this beverage was inappropriate to discuss, since I see it on the shelves in family-friendly places in my very conservative home town. Maybe there is some other problem with my review. Anyway, here goes.My husband and I joke about inventing a dehydrated brew to carry on our wilderness backpacking trips. I bought this extract and Alka-Seltzer Gold, hoping to come up with a recipe that would combine the fizz, the hop flavor, and a cup of spring water into an acceptable beverage.I tried several combinations of water, Alka-Seltzer and hops. Finally one effort produced something that didn't leave me wanting to rinse my mouth, but it wasn't good enough to finish the glass. No way would I carry the extra few ounces to drink it.When added to a cup of herbal tea, this adds a relaxing quality and the bitter flavor is not unpleasant.

It’s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it’s hard for me to get a “full” dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there’s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don’t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally — the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don’t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I’d have to get used to it.

The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity.

Yo por eso la meteré en la nevera para que el rango de vida se alargue.En cuanto al sabor no es horrible y la tintura viene bien precintada y cerrada, lo que impide su contaminación.

The first time I ordered a bottle I got Liquid Phyto-Capsules, the second time I ordered I recived capsules that seemed to either have powder in them or the liquid has dried up. The date on the bottle says 10/19, so I'm pretty sure they're not expired. I've been taking them like I normally would, but it's just...odd, because I know they're not supposed to look like this (unless they've changed?). I will still order these, I'm just confused. Hopefully I won't get sick or anything, I have 34 capsules left and I take two every morning.UPDATE: 6/12/17So I ordered another bottle a few days ago and received the bottle, to which on the box it stated that it was a new and improved formula. The capsules looked exactly like the ones that inspired me to write this review, they looked like the capsules in the picture. So the company finally got around to making it official that they changed the formula, on the box. I can't say for sure if this new formula works better than the old one, as I was sure that they were onto something with the liquid inside the capsule. Oh well. I ordered the elderberry syrup as well (not the nighttime one) and I take that sometimes when I need the extra help and want the benefits of having the liquid. So I guess just be aware that there's the change to the formula. Too bad they couldn't have just made another version of this capsule and kept this one with liquid inside.

I tried a tad bit plain just to see. I did mix the vial dose in my tea and it was actually kind of a nice  subtle addition to sweeten it up. The tea I used is Celestial brand, Bengal Spice. Will be perfect if you like cinnamon and ginger. And I do already feel the calming effects of it.

Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don’t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I’m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I’ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I’m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there’s still some energy to spare. I’m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It’s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I’m often working double shifts a day and I’m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it’s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I’m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I’ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41mHIWyk-lL._AC_.jpg

The liquid works better and faster than pill form. I was so thrilled to fund some affordable ones on amazon because it's difficult to justify a trip to sprouts for just one item and I have 2 small kids to tote around. This is a great quality product. It doesn't habe the alcohol burn like some Valerian liquids do. It does taste terrible when you first use it, but it doesn't really bother me. You kinda ha e to experiment with how much you need, I usually use about 1/4 to 1/2 of the dropper to get the effect I want.  This is also good for headaches and for relaxing as well. It works well for me as a sleep aid. I take it 30 minutes before I intend to go to sleep and it works amazingly!  No groggy feeling in the morning unless I took too much, but it's not like taking a sleeping pill or benadryl sort of groggy. I've never missed my alarm or slept til noon with this. Like I said experiment with how much you need. A while dropper full was too much for me and I'm slim,  5'6, in my mid 30s, for a reference, if size plays a part or just show tolerant you are with sleep aids.  Hope this helps!

I can't say that I noticed any difference while taking it myself. Fast forward a few months and someone I know was diagnosed with Lyme and asked me for some herbal recommendations. Amazon was out of the Montana Farmacy brand at that time so I searched and found this one instead. It's made in the USA and 3rd party lab tested so I felt that it was safe to try. This person had a definite herx reaction from taking this Cryptolepis.  The Lyme literate doctor that they see felt that this was a very positive sign that the Cryptolepis was working.I decided to try this brand myself and I can definitely tell that it's stronger and making a difference. It has a 1:3 menstruum ratio vs the 1:5 ratio of Montana Farmacy.  I noticed an increase in fatigue with this brand at first as it started fighting the Lyme bacteria. Now that I've been taking it for a few weeks, I'm feeling noticeably better and more energized even with a low dose.I've also recommended this brand to a second person with Lyme Disease and other coinfections. They were taking a different Cryptolepis and they feel that Secrects of the Tribe Cryptolepis is much better than what they were taking previously.I highly recommend giving this product a try if you're considering it.

One bottle was their regular high quality, bitter, highly effective product. The second bottle was watered down and I could barely taste it. I need more of this immediately otherwise I will start having seizures, difficulty breathing, lose my memory again and much more.

As someone who has been on many medications over the years with often negative repercussions I’m very much for the natural approach of diet, exercise, Therapy, and supplements.This is not my first herbpharm  tincture I first bought the chamomile and lemonbalm. I was already comfortable using this when I bought it I just didn’t realize how amazing it was for anxiety until recently when I started having crippling panic attacks again at the end of February. As someone who took Clonopin for more than six years, and then had to spend a year withdrawing and coming off of it I have to say this tincture gives me just as much relief. Without any of the side effects of withdrawal symptoms. That’s enough to be a win in my book. It’s reasonably priced it lasts a fairly long time you can also buy a 4 ounce bottle which I love as an option. I’ve known about this for years and like I said I’ve used some of the other ones I have for sleep and for anxiety this has worked the best for me however I’ve known about this for years and like I said I’ve used some of the other ones I have for sleep and for anxiety this has worked the best for me however. I originally bought this one for sleep. I have since ordered it two more times. I don’t actually noticed any sedative affects like some others have mentioned. Everyone is different And is affected differently so that’s important to keep in mind. It sucks to see the reviews bad mouthing these herb farm products for potency and what not. Your time would be better spent making a tincture of your own at home instead of writing reviews for products that work for hundreds of other people.

I put it in a glass of cheap bota box red; the flavor was very strong and herbal--I actually really enjoyed the taste but I'm a little weird about herbal flavoring in liqueur and wine, so don't trust me on that really.Bottom line, if sleep hygiene doesn't work for you, try melatonin on a strict regime. If that doesn't work, try it and Valerian. If that doesn't work, try melatonin and this.This is powerful in a normally adult way: you'll get sleepy, very sleepy.

The quality of Herb Pharm is the BEST!!  Using this along with Crampbark by Herb Pharm, I have completely stopped using OTC pain medicine for everything.  The combination of the two can beat any pain that I've had...other than the nerve pain associated with my herniated disk.  It has worked for headaches, menstrual cramps, spastic colon/IBS...and on most of my back and joint pain.  It does not make me tired but does make me more relaxed.  The taste is not a problem.UPDATE: I have discovered Jamaica Dogwood from Herb Pharm and I highly suggest it to all pain sufferers!!! I combine it with cramp bark for severe pain. I still use the Skullcap...but more for pain when I'm trying to relax or sleep...or just to relax. Jamaica Dogwood works on all pain including nerve pain. I finally can live pain-free with my herniated disk. When I recently started to get a flair up of sciatica (caused by herniated disk), I combined it with willow bark also from Herb Pharm, which is an anti-inflammatory (not to be used with any NSAIDs), which caused my sciatica to almost completely go away in 1 hour of taking the first dose. With in 4 days of using the combination my sciatica was GONE...instead of 30 chiropractor visits and tons of physical therapy which used to take up to 4 months to heal.

And ooohhh man does the anxiety just get worse over time. Over longer periods of stress, certain minerals in your body can be depleted, leaving you more and more anxious and stressed out. Obviously mineral replenishment and the restoration of adrenal function is your end goal, but that takes time.In the meantime, I've found that a few drops of skullcap when I've stressed out helps take the edge off. As with anything, overuse can be problematic and have side effects. But a few drops of this helps calm me temporarily. It's not going to have prescription strength powers..... but it'll be safer and have fewer side effects and issues on your overall bodily symptoms if you have milder bouts of anxiety.I also like to use this before bedtime to help calm my racing mind and get to sleep. My preference is valerian, but using that too frequently can cause it to use it's effectiveness. So I like to alternate out between skullcap and valerian, combined with hops, to actually get a good nights sleep. Enough sleep can help your body better manage your cortisol levels (created as a response to stress).

I tried cuttapering back, but it never worked. Then I read about Skullcap, bought this and the loose tea, but I have yet to try the loosetea as this is so much easier. I began taking it, without lowering my dosage. I waited a week, and then I began cutting down my pills, each time taking that dosage for a week. What I noticed the first week and it continues this way, is I feel relaxed and sleep longer. If I awake in the middle to the night with any problems, I take another dropper full, but that is seldom. Last night I got down to just scraping off just  a little of my Ambien pill, that it was just psychological that I needed it. . Finally, I realize now that I can sleep without Ambien. I will continue to buy this to have when we take trips. This product needs to be advertised more. I found out about when I got on a forum where others were trying to get off sleeping pills.

What a night!  I took it to help with sleep and pain.  I will say that it most definitely made me sleepy and I did find it calming.  However, for me it appears to be dangerous.  I woke up a couple hours after taking it.  I saw lights on under the bedroom doors (one leads to a hall and one to a laundry room).  It took me a long time to figure out where I was in the room.  I knew I was in the room in the bed, but didn't know where in the room the bed was located.  I then realized that I was upside down and half-off the mattress.  Not at all like me, I don't move much.  I got up and went to the bathroom and when I came back the lights under the door were not on.  I asked my husband who was in the basement playing a computer game and he said no lights were on to his knowledge.  So I don't know what happened!  I think I was half-asleep when I got up.  I ended up sleeping until 9 this morning but I have been groggy all day.  I should note that I am very sensitive to medications so it stands to reason that I would be with herbs as well.  But after reading about some issues with Skullcap and possible liver problems, I'm going to discontinue it.  Tonight I'm trying the Jamaican Dogwood.  I'll post about that one tomorrow.  By the way, I love Herb Pharm and have not been sick all year, which I believe is due to using their Mullein Blend.

I've purchased different brands, I make my own alcohol-based tinctures using all sorts of herbs.  This product tastes exactly like an alcohol-based tincture with material from the earth, exactly what you'd expect a medicinal herbal to taste like.  It has no fillers, no preservatives, no taste enhancers like commercial cough syrup made to taste like cherry to accommodate the finicky consumer.  People writing reviews that says, it tastes awful, it made them ""puke"" are probably not accustomed to taking botanical tinctures.  There is NOTHING, absolutely nothing about this tincture that differentiates it from most other herbal tinctures.  If you want bad taste, try sage or valerian in a tincture.  If you never smelled valerian, give it a go then smell this.  Based on the reviews, I thought that the mushrooms might have exceptionally bad taste profile different from other tinctures.  No, it smells and tastes like alcohol because it's 30-40% alcohol, with raw mushrooms from the earth.  I can't say it tastes good, nor can I say it tastes bad.  Those are very subjective  reviews based on your experience and tolerance for taking medicinal botanicals.  There is no foul odor compared to other herbals, but not as nice as something like elderberry.  It is what it is.  You're taking a medicine designed to heal your body.  If you're a lush, you'll have no problems.  The fact that you personally can't tolerate the taste is not a reflection of the product.  It would be reasonable to say, I didn't tolerate the taste but it's stretch to say it tastes like anything other than what it is.  REvise your expectations if you're not experienced at taking herbal tinctures with alcohol and ensure when you review it you tell others that it might have more to do with you then the actual product.  You might want to find a product with vegetable glycerin because it's sweeter and will mask the musty, earth flavor of the mushrooms.  It is what it is and it wouldn't be worthwhile if it tasted like cotton candy.

He has environmentally induced asthma, from burning out the bronchial hairs doing industrial painting, etc, without a quality mask.  (Please, I beg you, wear an OSHA qualified mask. He nearly died of pneumonia from not wearing one when he should have.  He was on prednisone, which ruined a hip joint, which led to a hip replacement - twice now.  Just wear the right mask and save yourself from possible repercussions down the road.)He used this all winter, along with a daily dose of Cordychi, (and a flu shot, which he gets yearly anyway) and did not get a cold this winter, first time in years.  Coincidence? Maybe.  But he thinks not.  Also, a relative of mine takes cordyceps and reishi, and is recovering from COPD.  He has been interviewed about this, and has been able to reduce his asthma treatments to just a couple a day from what I understand.  He's had asthma since he was a child, he's now over 60, was severely overweight for many years.  Between a massive weight loss and this stuff, and now being able to exercise, he is getting his life back. He recently walked across the province of New Brunswick in Sept of 2019. Google him.

I decided to try the liquid and this particular Tincture (mixed with a little alcohol). It's easy to administer, the package says 4 drops a day (or 4 ml), which means this bottle should last 15 days.  However, in the product description, it says to use 2 drops, which means the bottle will last 30 days. Based on my research, I suggest going with 1 or 2 drops a day so that one can analyze if there are any side effects and act accordingly. Once you assess the situation you can probably increase the dosage (or even stop it completely). I'm starting with 2 drops personally and am interested to see if it will affect blood sugar and cholesterol/triglycerides.I didn't taste the drops on their own, but I added them to my tea, I didn't notice any change in taste, though again I'm using 2 drops, so I'm not sure if there will be a difference if one uses 4 drops. You can also add it to food, like a salad, though you probably need to make sure that you eat all the salad serving to make sure you take the dose that you are on. I have high hopes for this product and will continue to consume it for 3 months and go for blood work to see if there are any benefits in the area I discussed above.

Includes a dropper (instead of a cap) and measurements up to 1ml so it is very easy to use and get the correct dosage. I'm a firm believer in natural products and using nature to not only sustain us but to repair us as well.It tastes surprisingly pleasant and while I add it to my morning coffee I wanted to know what the actual taste was on it's own and I'm happy to say it's tasty as well as a very light translucent golden colour. Adding it to my morning coffee the taste gets lost so I really don't notice its there.Promotes Better Immune System (which we all want) and Stress Response for a natural calm which in the busy season is a sure blessing! A win win in my book.I'm a little confused as to the dosage as the description says to take 2 dropper full's and each dropper holds 1ml so that would be 2ml. Yet the box it comes in says to take 4ml per adult dosage. And the bottle itself mentions a 4ml serving? So if I take 4ml per serving I would only get 15 servings per bottle. By taking 2ml per serving I will get 30 servings per bottle and if I only want to take 1ml per serving which for me seems reasonable I will get 60 servings so a 2 months supply. Anyhow which ever serving size you prefer to take I believe it will be helpful.I have a strong and healthy immune system as but the stress response for a natural calm is good as my husband says I'm grumpy before I get my coffee and as it goes in my coffee it's a win for both of us. I'm not so young anymore and finding something like this to help keep me calm, relaxed and healthy is great! Love it!Only time will tell as to the overall effect this will have on me and everything responds differently to different folks. But I've always felt mushrooms were good for me and to get the goodness in this tincture which is much more concentrated is wonderful!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pORVn-p1L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Jq8pT28eL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51p6SKv6DhL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41nULmUOMyL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41j3kcjKn6L._AC_.jpg

As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.

I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain.

California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called “glutamate” which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don’t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you’re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I’ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ErE1fXrhL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aN0fnenFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ta4W-IuKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AnYHzeOSL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+QNhdArQL._AC_.jpg

(Note - This Is Not For Pain)",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015",True,"I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OtQndo79L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/316CMENJCPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BtWrlD+sL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xEFBKeZML._AC_.jpg

The effect increases with larger dosage but I can see going through this wee bottle very quickly if you have moderate pain and need 20 or 30 drops. The effects fade after a couple hours. I wouldn't be comfortable using this at work or while driving as it makes me a little listless and sleepy.It tastes terrible--like fermented lawn clippings--but gets maximum effect dropped directly on my tongue. Even mixed in tea I can taste it but it blends in okay. I added it to a shot of Jack Daniels and the taste completely disappeared and made for a great nightcap on a restless night.

Having grown California Poppies for decorative purposes, I was not aware of a medicinal application, and so I was somewhat dubious regarding effectiveness. This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste.

Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FLWNq2vUL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bNmU4CB5L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mglMM3cvL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Zi+yKEzWS._AC_.jpg

Normally, I’d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different—a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I’d heard these were supposed to be nature’s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn’t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity—who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I’m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I’d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn’t feel groggy or out of it—just calm, focused, and oddly energized.

First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I’m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason.

I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.

And I have vivid long dreams which I LOVE.The only potential negative, which I do not care about and do not personally consider to be negative, is that compared to the DreamOn Zen, it doesn't help me fall asleep. I don't have issues falling asleep, but I do notice now that something about DreamOn Zen helped make me feel sleepier and go to sleep faster.My new plan is to take one dose of this plus one dose of DreamOn Zen instead of two doses of either one separately.So if your brain situation sounds like mine, try this. And honestly I also highly recommend trying DreamOn Zen too.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31cCJLEEADL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51UAKSV70tL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51np+NfWXYL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Zi+yKEzWS._AC_.jpg

However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep.

Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don’t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I’m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I’ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I’m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there’s still some energy to spare. I’m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It’s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I’m often working double shifts a day and I’m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it’s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I’m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I’ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41osMSgluVL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uL+4jEVqL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413OVDDZw3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PICpxyrpL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eJT4A8ArL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OV8OVnkiL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514k+16gK0L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CXPdq2iVL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ftXSuYn7L._AC_.jpg

It’s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it’s hard for me to get a “full” dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there’s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don’t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally — the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don’t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I’d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I’ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it’s such a strange combination of flavors I’m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.  In a pinch I would use this but I think I’d prefer a pill or just a simple elderberry gummy instead.  Just my preference anyway.

The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity.

The first time I ordered a bottle I got Liquid Phyto-Capsules, the second time I ordered I recived capsules that seemed to either have powder in them or the liquid has dried up. The date on the bottle says 10/19, so I'm pretty sure they're not expired. I've been taking them like I normally would, but it's just...odd, because I know they're not supposed to look like this (unless they've changed?). I will still order these, I'm just confused. Hopefully I won't get sick or anything, I have 34 capsules left and I take two every morning.UPDATE: 6/12/17So I ordered another bottle a few days ago and received the bottle, to which on the box it stated that it was a new and improved formula. The capsules looked exactly like the ones that inspired me to write this review, they looked like the capsules in the picture. So the company finally got around to making it official that they changed the formula, on the box. I can't say for sure if this new formula works better than the old one, as I was sure that they were onto something with the liquid inside the capsule. Oh well. I ordered the elderberry syrup as well (not the nighttime one) and I take that sometimes when I need the extra help and want the benefits of having the liquid. So I guess just be aware that there's the change to the formula. Too bad they couldn't have just made another version of this capsule and kept this one with liquid inside.

Hers was very bitter tasting, like a shot of vodka, so I was worried about that but THIS is pleasant in comparison. I did get the alcohol free bottle. It’s got a slightly sweet taste. Almost almondy. I tried a tad bit plain just to see. I did mix the vial dose in my tea and it was actually kind of a nice  subtle addition to sweeten it up. The tea I used is Celestial brand, Bengal Spice. Will be perfect if you like cinnamon and ginger. And I do already feel the calming effects of it.

Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don’t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I’m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I’ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I’m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there’s still some energy to spare. I’m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It’s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I’m often working double shifts a day and I’m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it’s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I’m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I’ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41osMSgluVL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uL+4jEVqL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413OVDDZw3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PICpxyrpL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eJT4A8ArL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OV8OVnkiL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514k+16gK0L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CXPdq2iVL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ftXSuYn7L._AC_.jpg

The liquid works better and faster than pill form. I was so thrilled to fund some affordable ones on amazon because it's difficult to justify a trip to sprouts for just one item and I have 2 small kids to tote around. This is a great quality product. It doesn't habe the alcohol burn like some Valerian liquids do. It does taste terrible when you first use it, but it doesn't really bother me. You kinda ha e to experiment with how much you need, I usually use about 1/4 to 1/2 of the dropper to get the effect I want.  This is also good for headaches and for relaxing as well. It works well for me as a sleep aid. I take it 30 minutes before I intend to go to sleep and it works amazingly!  No groggy feeling in the morning unless I took too much, but it's not like taking a sleeping pill or benadryl sort of groggy. I've never missed my alarm or slept til noon with this. Like I said experiment with how much you need. A while dropper full was too much for me and I'm slim,  5'6, in my mid 30s, for a reference, if size plays a part or just show tolerant you are with sleep aids.  Hope this helps!  Gove it a try, I promise it's worth it for a good night's sleep!!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41-35L2kpcL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uL+4jEVqL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413OVDDZw3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PICpxyrpL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eJT4A8ArL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OV8OVnkiL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ortpqTFFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419EcH8OgJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ftXSuYn7L._AC_.jpg

As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal.

I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain. I suppose it works for some people, but it definitely didn't do a thing for me.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+Foxie2+L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XpLXIi24L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KD-oBo6jS._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NPeBahFnS._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jU6e3a-8S._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41HLpfDdNeL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4153WRGqymS._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Sxq6JBEDS._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rkjoWyc6L._AC_.jpg

California poppy activates the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA helps to calm the body and the mind, and counterbalances the neurotransmitter called “glutamate” which excites the body's central and peripheral nervous systems.However, too much GABA can cause the exact symptoms you are trying to prevent! This is what happened to me after 4 nights of taking 1ml of this product at night. I experienced anxiety (with a tight chest), restlessness, and slight shortness of breath. At first, I thought the symptoms I was trying to fix were just getting worse, so I increased my dose a little bit, but my symptoms got worse. This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms. If you don’t feel any better, maybe you are too sensitive and you’re increasing GABA too much like I experienced.I know the product caused this feeling because I’ve taken GABA powder in the past and felt the exact same thing when I no longer required it my body started reacting badly.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ErE1fXrhL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aN0fnenFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ta4W-IuKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AnYHzeOSL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+QNhdArQL._AC_.jpg

(Note - This Is Not For Pain)",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015",True,"I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OtQndo79L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/316CMENJCPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BtWrlD+sL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xEFBKeZML._AC_.jpg

This product did produce sleep when taken as directed. I used the product intermittently several times with similar results. The sleep was hypnotic in nature and without dreams. There was some residual grogginess the following day, but it was not intolerable. The product was not overly offensive to take with an interesting herb-like aroma and taste.

Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FLWNq2vUL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bNmU4CB5L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mglMM3cvL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Zi+yKEzWS._AC_.jpg

Normally, I’d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different—a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I’d heard these were supposed to be nature’s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn’t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity—who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I’m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I’d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn’t feel groggy or out of it—just calm, focused, and oddly energized.

First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I’m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason. Similar products on Amazon are 600-800 mg per serving.Sleep is complex. California poppy will likely not help if your sleep issues are caused by liver or blood sugar problems.

I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KIbPz5ZJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tiyTvNPmL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OTX-E2AfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t+QesskGL._AC_.jpg

I tried a tad bit plain just to see. I did mix the vial dose in my tea and it was actually kind of a nice  subtle addition to sweeten it up. The tea I used is Celestial brand, Bengal Spice.

Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don’t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I’m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I’ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I’m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there’s still some energy to spare. I’m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It’s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I’m often working double shifts a day and I’m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it’s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I’m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I’ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41osMSgluVL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uL+4jEVqL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413OVDDZw3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PICpxyrpL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eJT4A8ArL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OV8OVnkiL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514k+16gK0L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CXPdq2iVL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ftXSuYn7L._AC_.jpg

It’s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it’s hard for me to get a “full” dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there’s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don’t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally — the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don’t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I’d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I’ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it’s such a strange combination of flavors I’m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.  In a pinch I would use this but I think I’d prefer a pill or just a simple elderberry gummy instead.  Just my preference anyway.

The bottle includes an eye dropper cap that is used to deliver the recommended 2 dropper full of the liquid. The ingredients includes extracts of echinacea, elderberry, thyme, sage, yarrow, and lemon balm in a proprietary combination. The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity. The liquid tastes quite bad so I recommend adding the 2 dropper full to some juice. I appreciate that it's made in the USA. I find the price point for 20 days supply to be rather steep.

The first time I ordered a bottle I got Liquid Phyto-Capsules, the second time I ordered I recived capsules that seemed to either have powder in them or the liquid has dried up. The date on the bottle says 10/19, so I'm pretty sure they're not expired. I've been taking them like I normally would, but it's just...odd, because I know they're not supposed to look like this (unless they've changed?). I will still order these, I'm just confused. Hopefully I won't get sick or anything, I have 34 capsules left and I take two every morning.UPDATE: 6/12/17So I ordered another bottle a few days ago and received the bottle, to which on the box it stated that it was a new and improved formula. The capsules looked exactly like the ones that inspired me to write this review, they looked like the capsules in the picture. So the company finally got around to making it official that they changed the formula, on the box. I can't say for sure if this new formula works better than the old one, as I was sure that they were onto something with the liquid inside the capsule. Oh well. I ordered the elderberry syrup as well (not the nighttime one) and I take that sometimes when I need the extra help and want the benefits of having the liquid. So I guess just be aware that there's the change to the formula. Too bad they couldn't have just made another version of this capsule and kept this one with liquid inside.

I tried a tad bit plain just to see. I did mix the vial dose in my tea and it was actually kind of a nice  subtle addition to sweeten it up. The tea I used is Celestial brand, Bengal Spice.

Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don’t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I’m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I’ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I’m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there’s still some energy to spare. I’m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It’s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I’m often working double shifts a day and I’m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it’s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I’m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I’ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41osMSgluVL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uL+4jEVqL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413OVDDZw3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PICpxyrpL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41eJT4A8ArL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OV8OVnkiL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514k+16gK0L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CXPdq2iVL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ftXSuYn7L._AC_.jpg

The liquid works better and faster than pill form. I was so thrilled to fund some affordable ones on amazon because it's difficult to justify a trip to sprouts for just one item and I have 2 small kids to tote around. This is a great quality product. It doesn't habe the alcohol burn like some Valerian liquids do. It does taste terrible when you first use it, but it doesn't really bother me. You kinda ha e to experiment with how much you need, I usually use about 1/4 to 1/2 of the dropper to get the effect I want.  This is also good for headaches and for relaxing as well. It works well for me as a sleep aid. I take it 30 minutes before I intend to go to sleep and it works amazingly!  No groggy feeling in the morning unless I took too much, but it's not like taking a sleeping pill or benadryl sort of groggy. I've never missed my alarm or slept til noon with this. Like I said experiment with how much you need. A while dropper full was too much for me and I'm slim,  5'6, in my mid 30s, for a reference, if size plays a part or just show tolerant you are with sleep aids.  Hope this helps!

I can't say that I noticed any difference while taking it myself. Fast forward a few months and someone I know was diagnosed with Lyme and asked me for some herbal recommendations. Amazon was out of the Montana Farmacy brand at that time so I searched and found this one instead. It's made in the USA and 3rd party lab tested so I felt that it was safe to try. This person had a definite herx reaction from taking this Cryptolepis.  The Lyme literate doctor that they see felt that this was a very positive sign that the Cryptolepis was working.I decided to try this brand myself and I can definitely tell that it's stronger and making a difference. It has a 1:3 menstruum ratio vs the 1:5 ratio of Montana Farmacy.  I noticed an increase in fatigue with this brand at first as it started fighting the Lyme bacteria. Now that I've been taking it for a few weeks, I'm feeling noticeably better and more energized even with a low dose.I've also recommended this brand to a second person with Lyme Disease and other coinfections. They were taking a different Cryptolepis and they feel that Secrects of the Tribe Cryptolepis is much better than what they were taking previously.I highly recommend giving this product a try if you're considering it.

One bottle was their regular high quality, bitter, highly effective product. The second bottle was watered down and I could barely taste it. I need more of this immediately otherwise I will start having seizures, difficulty breathing, lose my memory again and much more. It is very upsetting when these companies water down their products that we use as medicine.So now I am trying to figure out how to source a large amount of high quality cryptolepsis root in order to make my own tinctures. I've tried a few different brands of this tincture and they simply don't work. This brand had been the best, and I buy it because it ships quickly. I can't afford to wait a week or a week and a half.So I'm going to buy it one last time, and if the next bottle is similarly weak and watered down, and doesn't really taste that bitter, and doesn't really help my health, I give up.You guys are going to lose a loyal customer to try and what, save a few bucks?",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/317Re6kSuSL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51k18nCyTGL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518q6kpnuKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kL+7hv9kL._AC_.jpg

Often feeling as though the effects the people endorsing it describe are all in their head or that they are exaggerating.I can tell you my experience. I have had some sort of congestion for several months  that wouldn't allow me to get a full breath. It felt like I was breathing through a towel most of the time. I was coughing and producing some stuff, but it never felt clear. It seemed to actually be getting worse. I'm a singer and it also put a really bad hole in my range where I could sing above and below but couldn't hit the inbetween.I received this yesterday. I was skeptical, but the reviews were so good (including from decades long smokers) so, I filled the included glass dropper to the 1ml mark as there were not instructions beyond that I could use it 3 times a day.I squirted the substance under my tounge and held it there for a 10 count before swallowing.30 min later, (I'll try not to be too graphic) but I produced a larger than usual volume by a startling amount and this happened a few more times over the next half an hour, finally culminating in a coughing fit that ended with...A breath of fresh air that felt like I had been under water and finally reached the surface. Ecstatic doesn't begin to describe my mood.I took one other dose at the end of the day. This morning I was singing with only a few minor notes that were difficult BUT NO LONGER IMPOSSIBLE to hit. I feel like those too will get better in short order simply because I haven't been able to practice them.I was hitting vibrato I couldn't dare to try yesterday...it's not a miracle. But it's far more than I ever expected much faster than i could have dreamed. 0 doubt in my mind this product works!On top of that, it actually tastes pretty good.

As someone who has been on many medications over the years with often negative repercussions I’m very much for the natural approach of diet, exercise, Therapy, and supplements.This is not my first herbpharm  tincture I first bought the chamomile and lemonbalm. I was already comfortable using this when I bought it I just didn’t realize how amazing it was for anxiety until recently when I started having crippling panic attacks again at the end of February. As someone who took Clonopin for more than six years, and then had to spend a year withdrawing and coming off of it I have to say this tincture gives me just as much relief. Without any of the side effects of withdrawal symptoms. That’s enough to be a win in my book. It’s reasonably priced it lasts a fairly long time you can also buy a 4 ounce bottle which I love as an option. I’ve known about this for years and like I said I’ve used some of the other ones I have for sleep and for anxiety this has worked the best for me however I’ve known about this for years and like I said I’ve used some of the other ones I have for sleep and for anxiety this has worked the best for me however. I originally bought this one for sleep. I have since ordered it two more times. I don’t actually noticed any sedative affects like some others have mentioned. Everyone is different And is affected differently so that’s important to keep in mind. It sucks to see the reviews bad mouthing these herb farm products for potency and what not. Your time would be better spent making a tincture of your own at home instead of writing reviews for products that work for hundreds of other people.

I put it in a glass of cheap bota box red; the flavor was very strong and herbal--I actually really enjoyed the taste but I'm a little weird about herbal flavoring in liqueur and wine, so don't trust me on that really.Bottom line, if sleep hygiene doesn't work for you, try melatonin on a strict regime.

I’m very satisfied with Herb Pharm’s lavander & Passion flower oils- I just wish they worked ALL the time. I feel like when I don’t take it after 2-5 days they work better. However, if I’m using it everyday, I don’t feel like the results are as great. Either way, something is better than nothing- definitely recommend!

I rated this five stars for the formula as opposed to the delivery mechanism. I take the sprayer out and use a dropper to add it to water.

The quality of Herb Pharm is the BEST!!  Using this along with Crampbark by Herb Pharm, I have completely stopped using OTC pain medicine for everything.  The combination of the two can beat any pain that I've had...other than the nerve pain associated with my herniated disk.  It has worked for headaches, menstrual cramps, spastic colon/IBS...and on most of my back and joint pain.  It does not make me tired but does make me more relaxed.  The taste is not a problem.UPDATE: I have discovered Jamaica Dogwood from Herb Pharm and I highly suggest it to all pain sufferers!!! I combine it with cramp bark for severe pain. I still use the Skullcap...but more for pain when I'm trying to relax or sleep...or just to relax. Jamaica Dogwood works on all pain including nerve pain. I finally can live pain-free with my herniated disk. When I recently started to get a flair up of sciatica (caused by herniated disk), I combined it with willow bark also from Herb Pharm, which is an anti-inflammatory (not to be used with any NSAIDs), which caused my sciatica to almost completely go away in 1 hour of taking the first dose. With in 4 days of using the combination my sciatica was GONE...instead of 30 chiropractor visits and tons of physical therapy which used to take up to 4 months to heal.

And ooohhh man does the anxiety just get worse over time. Over longer periods of stress, certain minerals in your body can be depleted, leaving you more and more anxious and stressed out. Obviously mineral replenishment and the restoration of adrenal function is your end goal, but that takes time.In the meantime, I've found that a few drops of skullcap when I've stressed out helps take the edge off. As with anything, overuse can be problematic and have side effects. But a few drops of this helps calm me temporarily. It's not going to have prescription strength powers..... but it'll be safer and have fewer side effects and issues on your overall bodily symptoms if you have milder bouts of anxiety.I also like to use this before bedtime to help calm my racing mind and get to sleep. My preference is valerian, but using that too frequently can cause it to use it's effectiveness. So I like to alternate out between skullcap and valerian, combined with hops, to actually get a good nights sleep.

What a night!  I took it to help with sleep and pain.  I will say that it most definitely made me sleepy and I did find it calming.  However, for me it appears to be dangerous.  I woke up a couple hours after taking it.  I saw lights on under the bedroom doors (one leads to a hall and one to a laundry room).  It took me a long time to figure out where I was in the room.  I knew I was in the room in the bed, but didn't know where in the room the bed was located.  I then realized that I was upside down and half-off the mattress.  Not at all like me, I don't move much.  I got up and went to the bathroom and when I came back the lights under the door were not on.  I asked my husband who was in the basement playing a computer game and he said no lights were on to his knowledge.  So I don't know what happened!  I think I was half-asleep when I got up.  I ended up sleeping until 9 this morning but I have been groggy all day.  I should note that I am very sensitive to medications so it stands to reason that I would be with herbs as well.  But after reading about some issues with Skullcap and possible liver problems, I'm going to discontinue it.  Tonight I'm trying the Jamaican Dogwood.  I'll post about that one tomorrow.  By the way, I love Herb Pharm and have not been sick all year, which I believe is due to using their Mullein Blend.

I decided to try the liquid and this particular Tincture (mixed with a little alcohol). It's easy to administer, the package says 4 drops a day (or 4 ml), which means this bottle should last 15 days.  However, in the product description, it says to use 2 drops, which means the bottle will last 30 days. Based on my research, I suggest going with 1 or 2 drops a day so that one can analyze if there are any side effects and act accordingly. Once you assess the situation you can probably increase the dosage (or even stop it completely). I'm starting with 2 drops personally and am interested to see if it will affect blood sugar and cholesterol/triglycerides.I didn't taste the drops on their own, but I added them to my tea, I didn't notice any change in taste, though again I'm using 2 drops, so I'm not sure if there will be a difference if one uses 4 drops. You can also add it to food, like a salad, though you probably need to make sure that you eat all the salad serving to make sure you take the dose that you are on. I have high hopes for this product and will continue to consume it for 3 months and go for blood work to see if there are any benefits in the area I discussed above.

Includes a dropper (instead of a cap) and measurements up to 1ml so it is very easy to use and get the correct dosage. I'm a firm believer in natural products and using nature to not only sustain us but to repair us as well.It tastes surprisingly pleasant and while I add it to my morning coffee I wanted to know what the actual taste was on it's own and I'm happy to say it's tasty as well as a very light translucent golden colour. Adding it to my morning coffee the taste gets lost so I really don't notice its there.Promotes Better Immune System (which we all want) and Stress Response for a natural calm which in the busy season is a sure blessing! A win win in my book.I'm a little confused as to the dosage as the description says to take 2 dropper full's and each dropper holds 1ml so that would be 2ml. Yet the box it comes in says to take 4ml per adult dosage. And the bottle itself mentions a 4ml serving? So if I take 4ml per serving I would only get 15 servings per bottle. By taking 2ml per serving I will get 30 servings per bottle and if I only want to take 1ml per serving which for me seems reasonable I will get 60 servings so a 2 months supply. Anyhow which ever serving size you prefer to take I believe it will be helpful.I have a strong and healthy immune system as but the stress response for a natural calm is good as my husband says I'm grumpy before I get my coffee and as it goes in my coffee it's a win for both of us. I'm not so young anymore and finding something like this to help keep me calm, relaxed and healthy is great!

You can’t say too much about health benefits on sites in general, but if you take a look at it’s main uses, I feel this has been working to help things for me. I feel it has an ever so slightly minty taste to it.

The taste was pleasant and sweet, and the effects were relaxing. I purchased again and the second bottle was the same. Then I ordered a third bottle. When it arrived, sealed in its package like the others, I opened it and tried a dropperful. I nearly threw up. It tasted horribly rotten. Like drinking the juices from the bottom of a trash can. I gagged for several minutes and returned it immediately. However, I liked the first bottle so much I decided to try again. So I re-ordered and received another brand new, sealed bottle like the last. Guess what? Same horrible rotten taste. This time I did an exchange, and wrote the seller a note mentioning the horrible taste, and telling them I would not re-order a third time. Lo and behold, the next bottle I received was perfectly fine, just like the first two, with a pleasant sweet taste and calming effect. Thank goodness. All was well, until I finished that bottle and ordered the next one. Once again, I received a rotten bottle. I nearly threw up after half a dropper. It took hours to get the taste out of my mouth.  There were no odd or extenuating circumstances - the packages were well wrapped and safe, undamaged and not left in the sun. All three deliveries were in the fall/winter when temperatures were in the 60s or lower. There was no chance it went bad during transit. There is a huge batch of rotten product sitting in a warehouse somewhere, and they’re just shipping it out. Probably figuring most people won’t bother to return it. So far a I’ve had three bad bottles out of six. If you’re willing to take those odds, by all means order this product. You’ve got a 50% chance of having a very nice experience.

It’s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it’s hard for me to get a “full” dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there’s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don’t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally — the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don’t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I’d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I’ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it’s such a strange combination of flavors I’m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.  In a pinch I would use this but I think I’d prefer a pill or just a simple elderberry gummy instead.  Just my preference anyway.  Otherwise the product itself is clean and seems to be an excellent way to boost your immune system when necessary.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31wKRVSgBjL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41oNSMQK-GL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41JX0geSgtL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515GKJA1WYL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NdC601OxL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PagcIUGpL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ygWqNYiPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4156MM7qOpL._AC_.jpg

The bottle includes an eye dropper cap that is used to deliver the recommended 2 dropper full of the liquid. The ingredients includes extracts of echinacea, elderberry, thyme, sage, yarrow, and lemon balm in a proprietary combination. The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity. The liquid tastes quite bad so I recommend adding the 2 dropper full to some juice. I appreciate that it's made in the USA. I find the price point for 20 days supply to be rather steep. Overall, it's not a bad tincture to add to your daily supplement regiment, but it's not something I will continue to use given I have other more cost effective immunity support supplements.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31wKRVSgBjL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41oNSMQK-GL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41JX0geSgtL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515GKJA1WYL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NdC601OxL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PagcIUGpL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ygWqNYiPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4156MM7qOpL._AC_.jpg
