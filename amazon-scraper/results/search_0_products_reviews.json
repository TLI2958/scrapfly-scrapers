  "text": "This product helps with symptoms. Not 100%, but it does make a big difference.  Much, much better than other supplements I have tried e.g. black cohosh, chasteberry, dong quai, sage, soy, bioidentical progsterone. These other supplements have absolutely no positive effect. I checked with my naturopath, and she says that this Pacific Herbs formula works very well for some women. On the other hand, black cohosh, chasteberry, etc. work incredibly well for other women. You have to experiment to see which one works for you.This price is relatively high, I've seen it for between 40-55 dollars here on amazon.  I try to buy multiple bags when the price goes down. You have to order quickly since the price can easily go back up an hour afterward.I find this does not taste great as a tea, so I use the scoop to pour a dry dose in my mouth and then swallow with water. I don't mind the taste at all when the product is not in tea form, it has an herbal licorice flavor.-----------------Update: I was still taking this,, but I am so tired of paying 60 dollars a month ($720 per year). This is just too much to keep paying. I have recently started doing a castor oil pack every night and that takes away my hot flashes. Buying the castor oil is much cheaper than this formula, and it has additional benefits.",

I also take it in conjunction with fish oil and vitamin B complex.**** updated April 2015. I still use this product occasionally and believe it works, but have to lower my review from 5 to 3 stars because of the crazy increase in price.

  "text": "I swear this tea helped me get pregnant! This combined with acupuncture. I tried other fertility teas and many supplements for months and this one I took for only 2 months and got pregnant after my 2nd cycle. I think it also tasted amazing. To me it tasted like warm brown sugar water and it also helped my sex drive (sorry if TMI). My husband drank the mens tea the 2nd month only and that is the month we finally conceived, but it tasted way different... He just drank it quickly. I would highly recommend for anyone trying to conceive! Just make sure you are buying it from a reputable source.",

I use to take a prescription medication for those nights when I couldn't fall asleep but didn't like how they made me feel groggy in the morning so I tried this on a recommendation of a Holistic Nutritionist and was impressed at how well this product worked!  Without any side effects of course.  Tastes good, it comes in a packet that dissolves as opposed to a regular tea bag and it has a nice, mild flavor and dissolves easily.  Works better than a drug and I wake up refreshed because it has I think 12 healthy herbs to help you relax and get a good nights sleep.",

Like most people the first few days are the worst pain wise for me and the first few days i tried this the pain was less severe. The taste was also much more pleasant than I expected and could enjoy having a warm tea like concotion of this in the morning. It isn't a miracle pack and can't take endometriosis level pain away in a second, but I do feel it has approved and has helped more the longer I've taken it so I think it would be worth a try for anyone considering this.",

  "text": "If I could give this product a thousand stars, I would. I am now 44 and have suffered my entire life with DEBILITATING menstrual pain to the point of ending up in the ER SEVERAL times. About ten years ago, I was diagnosed with PCOS. It has been suggested, but never confirmed I also have endometriosis. I am very healthy otherwise, and have been vegan for 20 years as well as grain-free. Still, nothing has helped the extreme pain I've had to experience since I began menstruating some 30 years ago. Acupuncture took the edge off and I do recommend it, but the pain was still there. Motrin helped a little too, but made me experience abdominal pain (even though I only took one every 12 hours). And I really am not a fan of Western Medicine, except for emergency/trauma stuff. I have very short periods only lasting two days, but so much pain. Anyway, long story short. I was in my local health food store and asked (yet again) if they could recommend anything for SEVERE menstrual pain. They showed me this, and I bought. This is now my second cycle using this product, and my pain (normally a 10 plus) is about a 2, occasionally goes to a 4, but still manageable (without having to put crap [Motrin] in my body). MAJOR relief. I wish I'd known about this product YEARS ago. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!! I will continue to use this so long as I have a period.",

So often I read about a wild plant and how to make medicine and it\u2019s missing key information about how to process it. Also, in many foraging guides you can\u2019t tell anything about who the plant is based on the images. This book is my dream, visually. It has not only pictures of leaves and flowers and even petals, it has seed pods at different stages of development and leaf shape variation when relevant. It\u2019s so, so good.

  "text": "This book covers medicinal plants native to the Pacific Northwest. It starts out with a bit of pertinent information about foraging safety and best practices, and mixes in some of the author\u2019s personal spiritual relationship with the plants. I have to admit I wasn\u2019t expecting there to be a spiritual element to this book, but it doesn\u2019t negatively impact the ability to use this book as a reference. This book also describes the various ways you can prepare your foraged medicinal plants for use. This section is particularly informative.After all of the pertinent foraging information is imparted, the book gets straight to the 120 wild plants, which are listed alphabetically. Each plant gets a breakdown including its common name, its scientific name, any other names it might be called, and what the plant is used for. Each plant also gets at least one picture. You learn how to identify your plant. You learn where/when/how to harvest it. You\u2019re taught what each plant is used for, how to ensure a future harvest, and you even get a breakdown of how best to prepare your plant for its medicinal purposes. Do you use your cottonwood buds for a tincture? Do you use them for a salve? This book will tell you.The back of the book features a handy metric conversion chart, a list of references, and a helpful index that allows you to look up individual plants by name or by the ailment you\u2019re hoping to relieve.It\u2019s a data-packed book laid out in a fairly straightforward and thoughtful manner. Those curious about herbalism, foraging, or just native plants in the Pacific Northwest would really enjoy this. And for those not interested in the spiritual aspects discussed in this book, don\u2019t worry. The author\u2019s spirituality does not permeate the book in a way that negatively impacts its usefulness for plant reference.",

  "text": "While it looks like a field guide, it's actually an informative reference for the casual herbalist. Scott Kloos includes a lot of personal experience and opinion, which is the reason to buy this book I think. If you're looking for any medicinal science information or a comprehensive field guide then look elsewhere. One feature this book has that I like is the helpful instructions for how to harvest sustainably and prepare different remedies such as tictures or teas.It has some spiritual themes which is why I give it 4 stars. I wanted a guide to herbs, their effects, and how to prepare them, not an introduction to your brand of spirituality.",

  "text": "I just LOVE the way this book was written and the way the author conveys his kinship to the plant kingdom.  His introduction and explanation of how he got interested in the subject, and his description of his many years of working with medicinal herbs and wildcrafting, is reminicsent of own interest and enthusiasm.  I like the focus first and foremost on proper identification and the importance of having a minimal impact on the plants environments, when wildcrafting.  I also am happy to find a book with GOOD pictures and descriptions of what the plants really look like, in addition to describing the habitats where they might be found. Many of the herb books I have do not have pictures or drawings that really help identify the plants I am interested in finding.  I am carefully reading this book from cover to cover, and taking notes and doing drawings of my own, all BEFORE I venture out into the woods to try my hand at wild crafting.  I am glad to be getting back to my \"roots\", and regaining the knowledge, that was more commonplace years and years ago, of what the plants all around us can do for our bodies and spirits!",

  "text": "One of the things I appreciated about this book is that it provides an excellent overview of the topic for newbies, but also has enough depth for those who have some experience wildcrafting and working with medicinal plants. I enjoyed reading about best practices, safety, which plants you'll find each season, and how to harvest different parts.Chapter 4: Medicinal Plant Identification Guide, was my favorite part of the book because this can definitely feel overwhelming to someone just starting out. The info on botany/plant morphology was clear, useful and had just the right amount of detail to feel more comfortable with the terminology when learning to identify plants.The last section has a nice intro to some of the medicinal plants native to the Pacific NW, which can then be cross referenced in a field guide when hiking or exploring your neighborhood. A great book to learn about the many benefits of working with these amazing plants!",

  "text": "General interest in wildcrafting and herbalism has dramatically grown in recent years, and in response so has the appearance of publications and education programs designed to satisfy the demands of those seeking to become more knowledgeable and to develop their skills in the field. Beginning this journey of learning can be overwhelming without solid resources. This self-published introductory guide to wildcrafting, herbalism, and medicinal plants of the Pacific Northwest is one of the more recent books to become available.The author endeavors to cover a broad foundation of concepts for those beginning to learn, including ethical harvesting, plant identification (including poisonous species), basic plant uses in herbalism, an overview of the history of herbalism and plant medicine, and highlighting a basic inventory of common plants that can be found in the Pacific Northwest. It should be noted that a number of the plants showcased in this book can also be found widely throughout North America.As a reviewer, my opinion is that this book is a good starting point for those who are unfamiliar with herbalism and field botany, however for gaining requisite skills and knowledge there is no substitute for spending time out in the field with an experienced botanist and/or herbalist. Learning plant identification is a life-long art, as is developing deep relationships with individual medicinal plants. This book would be a starting point for someone seeking to begin their plant journey.",

  "text": "This book does a good job of detailing how and when to ethically harvest medicinal plants, and how to preserve and prepare them. It also describes 47 medicinal plants found in the PNW. Line drawings and written descriptions are provided for each species, as well as some basic botany to help in plant identification. Strangely the drawing for Thimbleberry appears to be a drawing of Trailing Blackberry, having the compound leaves with three leaflets of this related species rather than the simple five-lobed leaves of Thimbleberry. Overall the drawings do roughly emulate their subjects though. As a botanist I would be wary of beginners using these resources alone to identify plants for medicinal use, but in combination with a good field guide or two the resources provided would be useful.In terms of readability I found Boyle's prose to be a bit awkward at times. There doesn't appear to be an editor for the book, which does it a disservice. Nonetheless, the author's knowledge of and passion for herbology and wildcrafting make this book informative and engaging. I particularly appreciate his emphasis on ethical harvesting, and the gratitude and joy to be had from engaging directly with wild plants.",

  "text": "There was a great deal in here about wildcrafting/wild herb harvesting that I have not read before. The author repeated safety warnings many times - which is good, considering how easy it can be to have a reaction to a plant or accidentally find a poisonous look-alike. There were times I found the writing a bit confusing or odd, but it didn't effect my overall reading enjoyment. The line drawings were interesting,  but I agree with another reviewer that having another resource to verify plants against would be a good thing,  because personally, I would rather have a color photo to compare the plant to than just a line drawing - it would help me feel more confident in my identification. Also, this book isn't about PNW native plants,  although it does mention some of them,  it is about medicinal plants (some of which are considered invasive in Washington state - like Herb Robert) that grow in the PNW, and I have to admit I was hoping there would be info on more of the truly native plants.",

In addition to succinctly presenting safety info, such as the three most deadly plants (baneberry, poison hemlock, and water hemlock), he presents an ethos that is sustaining and helpful to habitat through nuanced gathering practices. For example, dandelion is so hearty you can feel free to harvest as much as you want, while endangered plants are off limits. Rory points to the needs for learning wild medicines as a form of reconnecting, healing ourselves as following our natural instinct. Enjoy taking this path, rewilding way of being!",

  "text": "A thorough monograph of each species features complete descriptions for identification and collection, medicinal uses and preparation.  Range maps aid in understanding general locales, drawings are accurate and useful, text is based on a sound grasp of cell chemistry without overdoing the technicalities, and is relatively myth-dispelling.  Responsible and authoritative from a practical intimacy, this hands-on guide also provides a glossary and cross-references.  A valuable addition to the herbals shelf, it would be nice to see this volume as a spiral-bound guide for field use.  The best yet of Moore's well-devoted works in my library.",

  "text": "I  have been looking for books on how to make medicines and identify plants. This book has been very helpful and I plan on buying more of his books. The book is well organized has some color pictures, location maps, line drawings, information on plant appearance, habitat, constituents, collecting and preparation, stability, medicinal uses and contraindications. It has a supplemental herb list, a theraputic use list, glossary and index of plant names.The only thing I do not like and it is not just with this book but with almost all of the plant idenification books, is that they do not have color pictures for all of the plants.They need that and when they do pictures they need the photos of all the plant parts. Many times drawings are just not good enough especially if you are new to this. The only reason for the four stars is the lack of color pictures.",

This guide provides you with EVERYTHING you need to know from the description of each plant to the habitat they grow in to the different edible and medicinal uses some of them may offer. One thing in particular I really enjoyed was there was a whole section going over toxic plants to be cautious of. I think this will be extremely useful for me when I'm exploring outside.

I would take off half a star for spaces between each word is missing in alot of places but I was still able to read it pretty smoothly.

  "text": "This is the first time I am consuming this product. After watching a few YouTube videos, I decided to make a gel to be used in smoothies. Based on the color of this moss, it seems to be good quality. A very little (like 1/5th of this bag) makes a whole blender full of gel. You have to wash this very thoroughly. There was not much sand in it but there were some other type of algae attached to it (in tiny amounts, but needed to be cleaned). It is easier to clean them after soaking the moss for a while. So, I washed it and then put in water with some lemon juice for about 4-5 hours (unlike 12 hours to overnight as recommended on the listing). Though it has tones of yellow and red in dry form, most of it is gone after the wash and it turns into a pinkish white noodle-like form. There were some thick and hard parts and some soft parts. The latter more quickly softens and the hard pieces become like soft leather, but this doesn\u2019t seem to matter. After putting the whole thing with some soak water in the blender, I got a pretty smooth and thick juice. I took a spoonful and I had no difficulty swallowing it. The gel has no smell or flavor to it. So, consider this as a neutral ingredient in whatever you are planning to make. This is just not your salad type algae, but it is pretty good for its suggested uses.",

We've been using a scoop of this in our parfaits, smoothies or even in our tea.

For the past two months, I've been suffering from back pain and neck soreness due to a lack of exercise and, to be honest, not having time for it. My mom recommended this product to me, as she had used it before with great results. I was skeptical at first, but I finally decided to follow her advice and give it a try. I have to say, I was amazed. The minute I put it on, I felt an instant warmth and a refreshing mint-like sensation on my back. The best part is that my pain and soreness were immediately alleviated. After using the entire box over the course of a week, I felt significant relief from the pain. The experience was gentle and soothing, and I also really liked the herb-like scent.

Applied one patch on my neck the for one night. The heat from the patch made me feel very comfortable and the next day my neck felt a lot better.Also this tiggers my interest in Tibetan medicine. Searched about it a bit, was impressed by the long history and \u201cbalancing\u201d philosophy of it. The natural herbal formula contains a blend of 6 plants, one of them is what we call Sichuan Pepper in daily life, another is the tumeric.

  "text": "The Homesteaders Herbal Handbook: 5 Simple Steps to Grow, Harvest, and Store 25 Backyard Medicinal Herbs to Craft Your Own Natural Remedies by Jenni Rempel is a very informative book that will delight even the staunchest of city folk.  Whether you have a lot of land or just a windowsill, with this book, you can help your own health and let's be honest, given the rising cost of modern pharmaceuticals, your wallet as well.  Ms. Rempel does include the reminder to check with your doctor before beginning this medicinal pursuit to help ensure your safety.  Various links are included to help expand your knowledge beyond the borders of this book. Modern medicine is still in its infancy compared to older established cultural practices such as Western Use, Ayurveda Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine and all three of the established practices have used herbs in the treatment of others for thousands of years and therefore, the benefits of the herbs should not be overlooked and if you're still doubting that, consider the fact that even the Father of Medicine himself, Hippocrates used these herbs and had listed 400 herbs for their medicinal properties in 5th century BC.Many of the herbs listed are ones that most people should be familiar with: Aloe Vera, Chamomile, Chili Pepper, Elderberry, Garlic, Ginger, Ginkgo, Lavender, Mint, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Sage, St. John's Wort, Thyme and Turmeric. The others are Ashwagandha, Calendula, Echinacea, Hawthorn, Holy Basil, Hyssop, Milk Thistle, Moringa, and Valerian. Covered subjects with each of these herbs is planting, the needs of the individual herb, how to harvest it, the best way to store them and what you can do with each herb after it's been harvested plus potential side effects, correct dosage, the traditional and modern benefits, possible interactions with other medicines, and who shouldn't use it as an herbal medicine.The one section that stood out to me not just because it's always a good idea to have alternatives to how you take any medicine, be it traditional or modern, but because after reading through it, I ended up making a lot of these or at least those that I had the ingredients for was titled: \u201cPutting those homestead herbs to good use with 16 simple recipes\u201d. These recipes range from curry to whiskey and while not quite everything in between, you'll be hard pressed not to find at least one that you'll want to devour out of these mouthwatering recipes.",

  "text": "I received the advanced copy link for the PDF version of this book about 2-3 weeks ago. I am an herbalism student, so I thought it would be helpful to tack this on for learning. It was quite helpful, as I did not inherit the gardening skills of my parents & grandparents. There are some nice tips in this book that I think will help out when I start to construct my pollinator, herbal/plant medicine, & vegetable garden out back. I've been actively trying to become a better DIY person for years. Just this year I dove in & started learning more with some local & online folks to forage, wildcraft, & homestead. This advanced copy was a great addition to my list of resources. There are some things I knew beforehand, as I've really only DIY'd with essential oils. Some recipes are very similar to what I've been doing for years. There are things I didn't know or hear about before. I'm hoping I can order a physical book, as the PDF version was a little hard to read with my eye issues. Sending it to my kindle finally worked. But the best viewing for this advanced PDF copy was the kindle app on my tablet. I've found out that PDFs show up differently & one doesn't have all the highlighting & note-taking capabilities compared to a digital book. I'm still one of those that cling to physical books, especially those for reference. This will be added to my physical library when I can afford it. I have enjoyed Jenni's emails & other sources of information since being introduced to her & her knowledge a few weeks ago. I'd definitely recommend it to a beginner. It appears to be laid out understandably. At least for me, who processes things a bit differently & might need a different way of learning than some other folks. I wouldn't call myself a beginner. Maybe more middle-of-the-road for some aspects, maybe an expert in others. But definitely a beginner as far as foraging, wildcrafting, & 90% of homesteading go.",

  "text": "Before reading \"The Homesteader Herbal Handbook,\" I had zero knowledge about herbs. To be honest, I only use pepper on my mashed potatoes and crushed red peppers on my pizza. Beyond that, I have never used anything else. Jenni Rempel, the author, does an excellent job of making the book easily digestible. It doesn't feel like you are reading a book at all. Instead, it feels like you are sitting down at a table, drinking coffee and talking about herbs and the benefits they can do for you, and how easy it can be to set up something to maximize the growth of these herbs. The book's format is easy to understand and comprehend from the front to the back, which optimizes the reading experience. It is a handbook. It'll serve beginners well and perhaps even keep seasoned pros on their toes. This book is very informational.Aside from the information, what this book does well, in the beginning, is it'll make you think. At the beginning of the book, the author dives into a few mysteries and the history of herbs. She attempts to answer the question 'can science and nature work together?', while \"herbs have an incredible history but lack the volume of scientific studies to prove their benefits. Pharmaceuticals are still in their infancy compared with traditional medicine\" (pg 19 of 166). I admire the attempt to wrestle with the question and give the best answer that can be given, the answer is both, and they need to work together in unity. The book is definitely worth the read.",

  "text": "The Homesteader Herbal Handbook is an essential guidebook to any greenthumbs trying to expand their backyard gardening or take it to the next level. The author, Jenni Rempel, has taken what can be a frustrating topic into an easy going, five step approach, filled with dos and don'ts, helpful tips on how to be successful.The book is an incredible resource, not just for outdoor plants but ones you can grow indoors. I was fascinated by the aloe vera chapter and will probably start growing my own in a windowsill. As it turns out, natural aloe vera is not green!! It is something companies add to their product in an effort to make it look more how we think natural aloe vera would look like.I love the homesteader approach to life. It is this rough enthusiasm for trying your best that appeals to me. I do backyard gardening and did not realize how much more I expand with different herbs that I had overlooked. Jenni really is through throughout her book on tips to help the plants live, what to expect along the way, what they can used for with natural or herbal medicine and what the science says on each. She strikes a good balance of, it is a good add on, not a replacement for modern medicine.I highly recommend this book to anyone who does backyard gardening, raised garden beds, has plants around the house or anyone who just wants to save a little money by growing something themselves.",

There's details about the uses of herbs throughout history and so much more.  It was interesting too read the section about before pharmaceuticals, how our ancestors survived using plants, herbs, and spices.  They had to go by trial and error.  That was interesting to read.This book is full of useful and helpful information about herbs.  There were several herbs listed.  Many I had not heard of.  I like that the author listed some uses for each herb for example what the herb is used for, like anti-inflammatory or heartburn.The author includes information such as details about harvesting the herbs and how to make the most out of it.  That was really nice to read about.Some of the herbs listed are Aloe Vera, Elderberry, Ginger, Lavender, Mint, Hyssop, Rosemary, Sage, Turmeric,  Calendula, Garlic, and more.It is very interesting to learn information about different herbs and the uses for them.  The information is very helpful and useful.  I personally really like using herbs instead of regular medicine so it was really neat to learn about some new herbs.The information in this book is wonderful and very useful.

  "text": "Have you been curious about where to start with herb gardening?  This book introduces you to the most common easy to grow herbs.  The author explains how to grow them, how to harvest them and shares both culinary and medicinal uses of herbs.  Recipes, usages, and very importantly cautions/contra indications are all discussed.  I was delighted to find reference to a library of full color pictures of the herbs discussed in the book available by qr code or going to a specific related website.  As I plant my garden this year this book will be a helpful tool!",

  "text": "We have a small family farm and I\u2019m a gardener with a growing interest in herbal remedies. I like the design of the chapters and the focus on easily obtained herbs with the inclusion of some less common herbs. It was definitely accessible and I appreciated the dosage info when available.I would have loved an reverse index by medicinal benefit, so I could easily find which herbs are recommended for respiratory ailments for example, rather than having to flip through the chapters to find that info again.All in all, a great beginner tome, and one I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll use as a reference in the future.",

  "text": "\u2026and it\u2019s already a 5 star experience. Ordered the 5oz sleepytime tea, as I love a good sleepy time tea but want to stop using tea bags. Order came 1 day faster than expected, VERY well packed, with more than 5oz AND a bonus 2oz pack of lavender mint. Both teas look amazing, and smell even better. All US sourced ingredients is key, and everything else is a bonus. Well done! Highly recommend.Sleepy time tea is brewing up right next to me, and about to be enjoyed. Thank you Harts!",

I paid for a medium size tea for sleep . And they sent me a cute letter with my name saying that they multiplied my tea in size and also gifted me a small bag of peppermint tea on top of that. Also they included couple of beautiful post cards. I felt so appreciated as a customer! Not saying that the tea itself smells as a fresh fields of mountain area\u2026 it made me sleep as a baby in just 5 mins! I am struggling with a severe anxiety and ptsd. So when i am saying \u201csleep like a baby\u201d- it means a world to me. I was having serious issues with my sleep ,nightmares and insomnia\u2026 and this herbs made me have a wonderful restful night! My husband also took a cup of this blend and was sleeping amazing as well. It tastes very very pleasant!So if u struggle with a healthy sleep or anxiety or any hard period of life when your nerves need a support - try this.Again- i am amazed !! And the customer appreciation is beyond perfect!",

  "text": "I wish this bag had a way to be resealed after opening. But it doesn't. I have to use a rubber band around it to try to keep it closed. It's odd that something like herbal tea leaves would not come in a closable container.Other than the inconvenience of that, this big ol' bag of organic peppermint leaves smells pretty amazing and tastes great. As soon as you open the bag, the strong minty, menthol aroma fills your nasal passageways and actually helps to clear them.It's potent, and the taste is surprisingly refreshing. At least it was surprising to me... I'm not used to drinking minty teas, and this one makes a delicious, bold tea with a slight tinge of sweetness and grassiness. You can smell that in there. It's more complex in aroma than one miggt expect.I like to mix it with organic raspberry leaves, organic elderberries & organic calendula flowers. But it really adds a perfect touch to herbal teas that are lacking in that little something, lacking in taste, in that pizzazz.Peppermint tea gives you a very cool and refreshing feeling, making it perfect for summer get-togethers, it gives you energy, and helps ease feelings of nausea. It's also known to give you mental alertness and clarity. This stuff is pretty powerful but not overwhelming in any way.If infused, the peppermint extract can be applied to sore muscles for some relief. You can blend with Arnica montana, Comfrey & Calendula as well, which are great for conditioning skin, healing bruises, and relieving soreness, stiffness and pain.I'm pleasantly pleased with this large bag of organic peppermint leaves, and I have so many plans for it! It really does inspire great ideas, and I decided to get the Spearmint leaves from Frontier as well. I promise to let you know how that goes!",

  "text": "I previously bought 1 lb bags of peppermint and spearmint tea from Davidson's and U.S. Wellness. Although they have a strong scent in the bag, the had almost no flavor, and definitely no flavor that I could identify as mint. The Davidson's spearmint was so powdery that it leaked out of the tea ball. This Frontier Co-Op bulk peppermint tea is an improvement on both fronts. First, the leaves are cut to the right size and don't leak out of the tea ball. Second, it has a strong minty smell and actually tastes like peppermint. I don't use any type of sweetener, which limits the taste. That's why I only give it 4 stars overall. With some sugar, it should be a great tea. Davidson's peppermint tea has gone up to almost $23 for 16 oz. Frontier Co-Op is $16 as of this writing. It's a no-brainer at that price difference. Note that I previously bought Davidson's spearmint, not peppermint, but based on the price I would not opt for Davidson's peppermint either.",

Do not hesitate to buy this used from Amazon Marketplace sellers, as I did.The book is large and beautifully fashioned and produced, with gorgeous full-color photographs not only of each herb, but of dozens of different species of each herb, and of every possible use to which herbs can be put. There are full-color pictures of crafts, teas, household items, massage how-to illustrations, dyes--to say nothing of prepared food dishes; this is actually a cookbook within an herbal!ONE CAVEAT: if you are looking for an in-depth gardening how-to, with exhaustive planting info, you might want a supplement for this book, which sticks to the basics. But every other herb-related topic is embellished and elaborated on. There are dozens of pages with full-color, labeled illustrations of different \"theme\" gardens you can plan. Whole chapters EACH on potpurri, herbal cosmetics, dyes, medicines, and household cleaners. Fabulous, unique homemade gift items like herbal-scented beads--that's right, painted beads made entirely out of herbs and plants!The food/cooking section alone is worth the price of the book. The dishes are fantastic. I have already made the Sweet Rosemary Slices and several teas and drinks, and they are wonderful. Almost every recipe has a full-color photo.I could go on and on, but rather than waste your time, I will leave you to hit \"Add To Shopping Cart.\"Money has rarely been this well-spent.",

  "text": "This is an excellent book, but there are a couple of drawbacks. First, and most annoying, is the ordering of the herbs by scientific name. Makes it hard to find the herb you're looking for. Second, it's a large book, takes up a lot of space on the table and doesn't fit on all shelves.It has served me well enough, but I recently came across\n  \nYour Backyard Herb Garden: A Gardener's Guide to Growing Over 50 Herbs Plus How to Use Them in Cooking, Crafts, Companion Planting and More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    and I have to say this is the book I would pick up instead, in retrospect. I may even buy it anyway. It's small, has all the reference information in this one (and then some), and more readily available.",

There isn't much and it's not blocking anything.  I found it charming.  The book itself has some nice designs for herb gardens.  There are beautiful live pictures of the plants including the roots, seeds flowers and leaves.  Some have pictures of the seeds and leaves when dried.  Each plant has a little history and description.  Book gives lifespan (example Hardy Shrub), and height.  It also sections on Cultivation; propagating, growing, harvesting, and preserving, Uses; Culinary, Cosmetic, Aromatic, and Medicinal.  The book is a bit larger than I expected so it's not one you could carry easily as it's about 14 inches by 8 inches.  These are guestimates.  :)  I am very happy with the book and look forward to using it for many years.",

  "text": "This book has so much information, I couldn't imagine not having it.  Each page or set of pages (depending on how much information) covers an herb or plant or flower, and it goes over myth and folklore of the plant, name meanings and origins, and varieties of the plant, as well as a sidebar that has the cultivation information (soil, sun exposure, growing tips and guides, harvesting and preserving) as well as possible uses (decorative, culinary, household, aromatic, medicinal, and cosmetic).On top of this, there's sections where the author goes in depth for planning an herb garden, basic all purpose small and large herb garden layouts and plants contained, patio, balcony, and indoor herb gardens, theme and aromatic gardens, the list goes on, with another ten or more.  Also included are smaller herb guides (herbs for flowers and foliage, salad herbs, herbal trees, etc), a guide to herbal decorations such as wreaths and hangings, garlands, herbal baskets and the like, herbs within the kitchen (soups, fish, meat, etc - just about anything you'd like to cook), herbs for the household (household products, dyes, papers, toys and trinkets, potpourri, etc), herbs for beauty, essential oils, herbs for health, cultivating and harvesting herbs...  Literally, there is so much information to be listed that I cannot summarize it all here.I find that this is definitely an indispensable volume, and it shows - my book has dozens of stickies in the tops of the pages, to mark everything I might want quick reference to (which, actually, doesn't work as well as I thought, since I have 7 levels of stickies...).The only drawback I can think of with this book is that it is not alphabetized in any way.  It makes it a bit of a pain to start, but the index does have an accurate guide (though it's in scientific names, not common ones).  I find, though, that this issue is easily overlooked, though, as this book is chalk full of information, and a book I won't easily get rid of!",

  "text": "This is a really great book about herbs.  About half of the book is an \"herb index\" with colored pictures and detailed information about various herbs.  This book focuses a lot on how to use herbs in everyday life.  There are tons of recipes, some for more common uses, like herbal soups and breads.  But there is a lot of information on less-common ways of utilizing herbs, like making herbal dyes, paper, potpourri, facial creams, and essential oils.  I haven't tried all of the recipes, so I cannot say for certain that they are all fabulous, but there is definitely plenty of information.This book has a 1988 copyright, and it does give off a little bit of an 80's vibe, but herbs haven't changed much in the last few decades, and the majority of the information is still useful.  While this book doesn't devote a great deal of time to actually growing herbs, it's a good book for learning how to actually use them.",

  "text": "This book is not about Japanese gardens, whatever the title. I have read a lot of books about Japanese gardens but the content of this book is not in concordance with what other authors write about Japanese gardens.Foto 4-7 is referred to as a bright, flashy and colourfull Chinese-style gazebo in a cultivated Japanese garden. The foto though shows indeed a Chinese-style structure but the garden shows a two-tier fountain with a manneke-piss on top ....  in a Japanese garden?The foto's are nice but nowhere are there descriptions given of what it is or where it is.Then there are a lot of fotos of beautiful acers, but nowhere is there a connection to the text.And finally there are the drawings and the maps/designs. The drawings, to me, are basic but ok. The maps/designs are terrible: they are inconclusive and no time nor effort is put into it to make them at least look good or in any way professional.To me this book is an absolute waste of money.",

The first is a basic introduction to herbs and spices including a brief historical view, fairly common information about growing and harvesting herbs. The second actually examines individual spices. There are photographs of the plant and the spice as well as a guide to how to use them. Recipes are interspersed throughout. The last section involves the art of blending spices. Featured a number of bends, rubs and mixes and additional recipes. I found the first part rather bland.  I liked the second part. The text is uncomplicated and I appreciated the culinary information and the sidebars with the suggested amounts to be used with different foods. The third section was my favorite with many interesting blends. Some of them require many ingredients which can become costly.  This book is well done and sure to delight the home cook and arm chair gourmet alike.",

  "text": "I researched many different alternative ways to help a family member who was shockingly diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma, a blood cancer. (I must say that the power of prayer is first and foremost in my books, but for those who are not religious, put that comment aside please and read on.)I wanted to find products that could help could help clean the blood and boost the body's immune system. I read great things about seaweed and how those exposed to radiation were using it to detox their blood. I also found that it is hard to get \"pure\" seaweed because much of it is contaminated in the ocean. I trusted this product's web site for the safety of this product and bought the Modifilan. It mentioned that is contains Fucoidan which causes certain types of rapidly growing cancer cells to self-destruct. Promoting apoptosis (self-destruction of cancer cells), Fucoidan helps to naturally eliminate harmful cells from organism.It is expensive, but completely worth it. After only several months of taking this daily along with these other products, which I will list below, the cancer disappeared. It was a truly miracle to all of us and the doctors could not explain it, but I believe that these products greatly helped along with a change in diet (eliminate sugar and eat veggies). The other products that were taken in combination with this were, listed from most important to least taken were: Essiac, IP-6, Source Naturals Immune Defense (mushrooms), liquid chlorophyll, Krill oil,  Purple Defense, Momordica extract, Curcumin. Yes, I know it's a lot and you can never know for sure which one helped the most, but maybe the combination of them all did. I just wanted to list them so that others who might be in a similar situation, who are looking for cancer fighting products, can easily see what may work for them.",

  "text": "I have taken this off and on for years now. I was treated for Lyme disease late 2013 in Scottsdale.  Prior to going to AZ for treatment I had all of my mercury fillings removed and teeth fixed by an awesome dentist. I tested off the charts for both lead and mercury.  While undergoing IV treatment it included some chelation to lower my heavy metals.  By the end of my treatment I was tested again and they were lowered, but still higher than one wants. My Lyme doctor told me when I returned home to Texas I would need to continue chelation therapy. I bought an IV package, but it took 3 months before the home doctor re-tested me for heavy metals before we began chelation therapy.  During those 3 months I took 5-7 Modifilan daily just to help with my energy and I was low on iodine. Shockingly, when my chelation test came back after the 3 months of taking Modifilan my lead and mercury and other heavy metal levels were so low we did not have to do a single chelation treatment!!!  The 3 months of brown seaweed had pulled it out. I had read that it would, but did not know that it would do so efficiently! I always took it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a big glass of water due to the iodine. Side benefit it helped my BM's to be smoother and easier to pass.Update: June 8, 2018  I am still taking the Modifilian. When I run out I definitely  notice. Still love it. It still helps with my energy and I am assuming that it is still removing mercury. As your body detoxes heavy metals little by little more will dump from the cells. It is also still helping the bowels move normally.",

Though I had had all the mercury fillings removed and replaced from my teeth, i had never chelated the residues from my system (30 yrs of mercury in my mouth).  I used Modifilan for about 45 days only.  Recently I did a heavy metal toxicity test, and the amount of mercury and lead were incredibly low in my system.I had recommended Modifilan to a patient of mine whose mercury levels were off the charts high.  After taking Modifilan for 2 months, his levels became completely low.Other patients have told me the increased energy levels from taking Modifilan.I think it's a great product and I use it every 6 months for a month as part of a detoxification/cleansing of my system.",

I work in a vitamin store so I have tried a lot of supplements for energy and whatnot but this is by far the best. I had a ct scan about 4 months ago and had a shot of the contrast fluid. I had a \"slight\" allergic reaction to it including itchy throat, redness on chest and shortness of breath. 4 months later, I'm still short of breath. To my knowledge, this is due to the radiated iodine shot they gave me. The radiologist and GI doc said I would excrete it in my urine but that is definitely false. The radiologist ever freaked out when she saw I had a reaction and said, \"this rarely happens! Let me get another doctor hold on.\" That doctor said, \"I think she's having a reaction because she's so small.\" To which I said, \"do you give the same amount to everyone?\" He said YES \ud83d\ude32  I even went to urgent care to have a chest xray and everything came back normal and the doc said it was anxiety but I know what that feels like and this was different.

  "text": "I bought this product for help with energy and weight loss. Ive been taking it for about 2 weeks now and this product is the only thing different ive been doing. Amazingly it seems to be helping with....smoking. I usually smoke about 6-7 cigarettes a day and since taking this my urges went way down almost immediately. Im now down to 1-2 cigarettes a day. Nothing ive read says this product helps with smoking but it sure is doing something to help with my urges. Now i think about cigarettes and think nope just dont sound appealing. I Havent lost any weight yet but my appetite is down. Not quite sure about the energy, i do feel more focused though.Update 3/31/2017I don't seem to be benefiting from this at all. I'm not sure if it was a placebo affect that helped with the smoking or not. But it's been a month now and I see no difference in it, after the first week. I'd be willing to try it again just don't really want to spend money on something that shows no results. I'm on a strict low carb diet, I exercise and also take a 5htp supplement. Downgrading my rating from a 4 star to a 3. Sorry but not results. I'm trying to find something that helps with energy level and brain fog. Did not seem to help with that at all. However every body is different.",

Worldwide research is continuously being done and brown seaweed has been found to be the most beneficial type. This product, MODIFILAN, is the purest, most natural nutritional supplement made from the brown seaweed Laminaria Japonica. Extract contains the life essential properties of Organic Iodine, Alginates, Fucoidan and Laminarin. Worldwide scientific studies and clinical research of these elements showed: *Organic Iodine feeds the Thyroid Gland, which controls metabolism and promotes maturation of the nervous system. Iodine is important for thyroid disorders, wherever underactive or overactive. *Alginate is a natural absorbent of radioactive elements, heavy metals and free radicals. It has the unique ability of binding heavy metals and radioactive elements to its own molecules. As the Alginate cannot be broken down by the bile or saliva and cannot be absorbed by the body, it is secreted from the body together with the heavy metals and radioactive substances. *Fucoidan causes certain types of rapidly growing cells to self-destruct. Promoting apoptosis, Fucoidan helps to naturally eliminate harmful cells from organism. *Laminarin is a polysaccharide helpful in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

The results are are fairly good; I'm am on it now, here is what I feel- Very energetic, I am at work now, but would love to hit the gym.- I feel confident in being outspoken and engaging; even aggressively if need be, in any conversation with anyone regardless of their status.- It seems all the noise around me is toned down, however the noise pitch of people or music is much more intense.- I feel like writing, which I am actually doing writing this.- My anxiety and sense of under achievement is still prevalent, but to a much lesser extent than other days.- I am not hungry, and the thought of eating anything that is not culinary or nutritionally balanced seems discussing.Btw it says on the bottle \"For maximum benefits, take 6 capsules in the morning with a full glass of water. Do they mean take them all at once ? has anyone tried that ?",

  "text": "I researched many different alternative ways to help a family member who was shockingly diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma, a blood cancer. (I must say that the power of prayer is first and foremost in my books, but for those who are not religious, put that comment aside please and read on.)I wanted to find products that could help could help clean the blood and boost the body's immune system. I read great things about seaweed and how those exposed to radiation were using it to detox their blood. I also found that it is hard to get \"pure\" seaweed because much of it is contaminated in the ocean. I trusted this product's web site for the safety of this product and bought the Modifilan. It mentioned that is contains Fucoidan which causes certain types of rapidly growing cancer cells to self-destruct. Promoting apoptosis (self-destruction of cancer cells), Fucoidan helps to naturally eliminate harmful cells from organism.It is expensive, but completely worth it. After only several months of taking this daily along with these other products, which I will list below, the cancer disappeared. It was a truly miracle to all of us and the doctors could not explain it, but I believe that these products greatly helped along with a change in diet (eliminate sugar and eat veggies). The other products that were taken in combination with this were, listed from most important to least taken were: Essiac, IP-6, Source Naturals Immune Defense (mushrooms), liquid chlorophyll, Krill oil,  Purple Defense, Momordica extract, Curcumin. Yes, I know it's a lot and you can never know for sure which one helped the most, but maybe the combination of them all did. I just wanted to list them so that others who might be in a similar situation, who are looking for cancer fighting products, can easily see what may work for them.",

  "text": "I have taken this off and on for years now. I was treated for Lyme disease late 2013 in Scottsdale.  Prior to going to AZ for treatment I had all of my mercury fillings removed and teeth fixed by an awesome dentist. I tested off the charts for both lead and mercury.  While undergoing IV treatment it included some chelation to lower my heavy metals.  By the end of my treatment I was tested again and they were lowered, but still higher than one wants. My Lyme doctor told me when I returned home to Texas I would need to continue chelation therapy. I bought an IV package, but it took 3 months before the home doctor re-tested me for heavy metals before we began chelation therapy.  During those 3 months I took 5-7 Modifilan daily just to help with my energy and I was low on iodine. Shockingly, when my chelation test came back after the 3 months of taking Modifilan my lead and mercury and other heavy metal levels were so low we did not have to do a single chelation treatment!!!  The 3 months of brown seaweed had pulled it out. I had read that it would, but did not know that it would do so efficiently! I always took it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a big glass of water due to the iodine. Side benefit it helped my BM's to be smoother and easier to pass.Update: June 8, 2018  I am still taking the Modifilian. When I run out I definitely  notice. Still love it. It still helps with my energy and I am assuming that it is still removing mercury. As your body detoxes heavy metals little by little more will dump from the cells. It is also still helping the bowels move normally.",

Though I had had all the mercury fillings removed and replaced from my teeth, i had never chelated the residues from my system (30 yrs of mercury in my mouth).  I used Modifilan for about 45 days only.  Recently I did a heavy metal toxicity test, and the amount of mercury and lead were incredibly low in my system.I had recommended Modifilan to a patient of mine whose mercury levels were off the charts high.  After taking Modifilan for 2 months, his levels became completely low.Other patients have told me the increased energy levels from taking Modifilan.I think it's a great product and I use it every 6 months for a month as part of a detoxification/cleansing of my system.",

I work in a vitamin store so I have tried a lot of supplements for energy and whatnot but this is by far the best. I had a ct scan about 4 months ago and had a shot of the contrast fluid. I had a \"slight\" allergic reaction to it including itchy throat, redness on chest and shortness of breath. 4 months later, I'm still short of breath. To my knowledge, this is due to the radiated iodine shot they gave me. The radiologist and GI doc said I would excrete it in my urine but that is definitely false. The radiologist ever freaked out when she saw I had a reaction and said, \"this rarely happens! Let me get another doctor hold on.\" That doctor said, \"I think she's having a reaction because she's so small.\" To which I said, \"do you give the same amount to everyone?\" He said YES \ud83d\ude32  I even went to urgent care to have a chest xray and everything came back normal and the doc said it was anxiety but I know what that feels like and this was different.

  "description": "The powers of seaweeds have been drawn upon for centuries for their ability to prolong life, prevent disease, impart beauty and health. Worldwide research is continuously being done and brown seaweed has been found to be the most beneficial type. This product, MODIFILAN, is the purest, most natural nutritional supplement made from the brown seaweed Laminaria Japonica. Extract contains the life essential properties of Organic Iodine, Alginates, Fucoidan and Laminarin. Worldwide scientific studies and clinical research of these elements showed: *Organic Iodine feeds the Thyroid Gland, which controls metabolism and promotes maturation of the nervous system. Iodine is important for thyroid disorders, wherever underactive or overactive. *Alginate is a natural absorbent of radioactive elements, heavy metals and free radicals. It has the unique ability of binding heavy metals and radioactive elements to its own molecules. As the Alginate cannot be broken down by the bile or saliva and cannot be absorbed by the body, it is secreted from the body together with the heavy metals and radioactive substances. *Fucoidan causes certain types of rapidly growing cells to self-destruct. Promoting apoptosis, Fucoidan helps to naturally eliminate harmful cells from organism. *Laminarin is a polysaccharide helpful in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It exhibits 30% of the anticoagulant activity of heparin. These elements, treasured in brown seaweeds, are enhanced by patented cold-temperature extraction technology, which does not break their molecular structure. And MODIFILAN is not just another dry seaweed product - it is highly concentrated product. FORTY pounds of raw seaweed is needed to make ONE pound of MODIFILAN.",

  "text": "I bought this product for help with energy and weight loss. Ive been taking it for about 2 weeks now and this product is the only thing different ive been doing. Amazingly it seems to be helping with....smoking. I usually smoke about 6-7 cigarettes a day and since taking this my urges went way down almost immediately. Im now down to 1-2 cigarettes a day. Nothing ive read says this product helps with smoking but it sure is doing something to help with my urges. Now i think about cigarettes and think nope just dont sound appealing. I Havent lost any weight yet but my appetite is down. Not quite sure about the energy, i do feel more focused though.Update 3/31/2017I don't seem to be benefiting from this at all. I'm not sure if it was a placebo affect that helped with the smoking or not. But it's been a month now and I see no difference in it, after the first week. I'd be willing to try it again just don't really want to spend money on something that shows no results. I'm on a strict low carb diet, I exercise and also take a 5htp supplement. Downgrading my rating from a 4 star to a 3. Sorry but not results. I'm trying to find something that helps with energy level and brain fog. Did not seem to help with that at all. However every body is different.",

The results are are fairly good; I'm am on it now, here is what I feel- Very energetic, I am at work now, but would love to hit the gym.- I feel confident in being outspoken and engaging; even aggressively if need be, in any conversation with anyone regardless of their status.- It seems all the noise around me is toned down, however the noise pitch of people or music is much more intense.- I feel like writing, which I am actually doing writing this.- My anxiety and sense of under achievement is still prevalent, but to a much lesser extent than other days.- I am not hungry, and the thought of eating anything that is not culinary or nutritionally balanced seems discussing.Btw it says on the bottle \"For maximum benefits, take 6 capsules in the morning with a full glass of water. Do they mean take them all at once ? has anyone tried that ?",

  "text": "It's Beef Broth and yes there's a difference. Some Beef Broth is really a vege broth with beef and no so much of beef at all. This broth ticks all the boxes, I use it instead of water for ramen and or Asian noodle meals, also Mexican ramen. They taste much better and you can choose if you want to add the \"spice\" powder or not which is mainly hot chili powder and sodium, you can add your own chili sauce, skip the sodium and have a much better meal. I've bought organic Beef Bone Broth but it's a waste of money, costs twice as much as this broth and isn't as beefy. So I say give this broth a try, be sure of what you're buying since this brand also makes a \"beef broth\" that is the same as I mentioned above, I want beef and nothing but the beef.",

  "text": "My wife and I are lifelong gardeners and we have a whole array of beds for everything from perennials to annuals, bulbs, herbs and vegetables.We agreed to review this set through the Vine program and we are reviewing these now, because a review at the end of the season doesn't seem as though it will help gardeners who are ordering their supplies right now. So, we're reviewing this set based on our veteran \"eye\" as gardeners.First, we like the array of seeds and they're perfect for a big raised bed we plant fresh each year with seeds.Then, we're also aware that most gardeners, ourselves included, would prefer to buy our seeds either from our favorite garden stores or from our gardening catalogues, selecting each packet of seeds individually. So, the main benefit of this offering is that it's priced quite reasonably. You're getting a dozen packets of seeds here at quite a reduced price, compared with the cost of selecting individual packets.Finally, if you are considering ordering this set, please read more about each variety. Veteran gardeners will recognize right away that this is a set that mixes annuals and perennials. For example, in our experience, dill tends to be an annual, although there are biennial varieties. But planting lavender will start a perennial patch, if you take care of your garden. You'll want to learn about these plants before you place them.",

I\u2019m excited to start these seeds in about a month, but it\u2019s nice knowing that they will be good for at least another year according to the date stamped across the back.I\u2019ve never grown tea varieties before but I know I\u2019ll definitely consume the chamomile and mint as tea and use the basil for savory dishes. The remaining varieties I\u2019ll plant as ornamentals for their fragrance. I wasn\u2019t expecting to receive everything in a nice resealable pouch, but it looks pretty and giftable. If most of the seeds germinate then I may buy this set for my gardener friends too!",

  "text": "**Note:  My review is based on the Australian version of this book. \"The Complete Guide Medicinal Herbal By Penelope Ody - An A-Z of over 120 medicinal herbs for all Australians.\"***This is my favourite beginner's book. Not because it is basic, as it is not but because of its easy page -per-herb layout. Although there is terminology that may yet be foreign to the beginner the wording used throughout this publication is easy to follow and very personable.Leading with an historic introduction Penelopy Ody gives the reader some background into the origins of herbal medicine. Each herb is discussed in terms of its historical background, parts used and applications. There are full-colour photographs to help the reader identify various parts of each plant. This book does not contain some of the herbs you might find in Mrs Grieve's A Modern Herbal but it is a more than adequate source of information particularly for the home user. Unlike some other herbals, Ms Ody includes small sections dedicated to the lesser known herbal lore of Ayurvedic Herbs out of India, Australian bush herbs, South American rainforest remedies and even some types of funghi .Approximately two thirds of the book is herb lore, the remaining third shows the reader what to do with this newly acquired knowledge. Using easy to follow photographs the author takes the reader from harvesting and drying to the techniques involved in making the various remedies. There are basic formulas which can be adapted to many recipes. Charmingly, although the quantities given are standardised, the measurements are provided in metric as well as kitchen utensil equivalent. For example, 62.5mls is given to equal 1 sherry glass whereas 150mls is the same as one tea cup. The section on home remedies goes into the nitty gritty of treating common ailments, suggesting combinations of herbs appropriate for each condition and cautioning the use of some herbs in certain situations.It is fabulous to see a herbal that addresses some issues unique to Australia, includes some of our native bush remedies, is written in non US English and most importantly it contains a comprehensive list of Australian and New Zealand address list of organisations and practitioners.Now the bad news, I have looked high and low to find copies of this book. There are some used copies available on Amazon but I can't find new ones. They may be out there, but even the publishers' website does not feature it in their search engine. Before you howl with disappointment though, there are other versions of the same book. I ended up buying the American version which is almost identical. I have noticed a few exclusions in the herb department, such as Khella and Galangal but then the use of Khella is restricted in Australia anyway. There are over 130 herbs in this version probably based on the use of Native American remedies in the US. Of course there are not the lists of Australian/NZ contacts that I mentioned.",

This one is great for the coffee table, it is big, hardcover and looks nice. Most books on herbology will give you a dictionary listing of the herbs and what they are good for. The second half of most books has the dictionary symptom of ailments and what herbs can be used to treat them. This book has more.The first part of the book talks about different philosophies around herbs. The author discusses Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Greek medicine , European medicine going up until today. This tome will teach the student how to prepare teas, oil infusions and tinctures. There is a section on how to grow and harvest your herbs as well.When describing the herbs you get a full page based on that herb. There is a picture of the herb and all the parts that are used. There is also a subsection on the page dealing  applications . The various ailment that plague us are listed in chart form. So you get the ailment, what herb you should use and how the herb should be prepared. It is easy to understand .",

  "text": "Though I haven\u2019t foraged in night on to 70 years, this book has ignited a spark to once again head for the hills, or at least the flats, and see what can be found. This book is easy to read and understand. Mr. Macy uses actual photos of the plants and fine drawings. I would not hesitate to take his book and forage.I did find the recipes at the end difficult to read, as the brown seemed to bleed into the white letters, but not impossible. And I would have liked, since this is a book on the Pacific Northwest to have seen a few more plants mentioned, e.g., Chamomile, Devil\u2019s Club, Fir Trees, Russian Olive, Miner\u2019s Lettuce, and one found in Eastern Oregon and Washington, Datura. I don\u2019t think we have enough Pine Trees to make them worth the mention, though I could be wrong.I appreciated how Mr. Mace stressed sustainable harvesting, not just when to harvest, but how. I thought his ideas on cooking, serving, or saving/preserving were quite well done and appreciated. I would add one more item to my foraging kit: brand name hand sanitizer. I\u2019ve found it works well on bites and blisters to cut the sting and burn, as well as cleaning hands.If you\u2019ve ever considered foraging for food, fun, or profit, this is the book for you. Nicely done.",

Not only does it cover some of the most useful, tasty wild edible and medicinal plants to be found in the region, but it also teaches foragers what to look out for in terms of poisonous lookalikes, making identification much easier.One thing I REALLY love about this book is the information on ethical harvesting. So, not only can you go out into the wild and find what you're looking for, but you also learn how to help these plants continue growing so others can enjoy them, too. It is incredibly well-written and makes for a fast, easy-to-digest read and guides people in the preparation and preservation of their harvests. It's truly an invaluable resource to the PNW forager that will thumbed through over and over again.",

There is always something new to learn and the descriptions accompanied with the photos are seriously helpful. I have to say my favorite part though would have to be the chapter on remembering to take the time and build a relationship with the Trails and nature. To make sure you thank the plants for what they are providing you with, as well not over harvesting so that you may return in the future to the beautiful places. Truly inspiring while making you just want to head on out on the next foraging adventure.Thank you \ud83e\udd17",

I have done a lot of research on different supplements and medications that might help with the bladder pain and I came across this.  I took the entire bottle per the labels instructions, but I never noticed my pain subsiding. I don't want to rate it poorly and potentially deter someone else from trying it. bc wWe are all different and our bodies are different and what may not help me, could have the potential to greatly help someone else.  It's also possible that it may take more than 1 bottle before I start to notice any results; but my Dr asked me to stop taking these while I began the Oxybutynin ER, so I didn't purchase another bottle.",

  "text": "Okay, so who isn't always on the lookout for a miracle? Especially when it comes to managing issues like bladder and kidney health, right? Well, honey, you've hit the jackpot here! I mean, the \"InterCyst Miracle\u201d just screams it's going to work wonders. I just got my hands on it and I really have high hopes for this one.It's supposedly loaded with all these natural goodies like vitamins and GABA (no idea what that is but it sounds fancy, so I'm in). Plus, it's made right here in the USA, which is pretty rad. You'd think with a name like \"InterCyst Miracle,\" this thing would be sprinkling magic dust left, right and center.I'm yet to see the miracle happen but hey, if it can bring some relief to my life, it\u2019s definitely worth the shot. Here's to hoping I\u2019m dodging bullets like Neo in the Matrix soon, goodbye discomfort! Tune in later for the updated journey of a lady and her not-so-little miracle pill. Stay healthy, folks!",
