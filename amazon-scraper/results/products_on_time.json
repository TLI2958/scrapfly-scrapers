Native Americans in California prized them as a source of food and for the oil that could be extracted from the plant. Eschscholzia californica was the first named member of the genus Eschscholzia, which was named by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso after the Baltic German botanist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, his friend and colleague on Otto von Kotzebue\u2019s scientific expedition to California and the greater Pacific in mid-1810s aboard the Russian ship Rurik.",

  "description": "Our delicious GaiaKids Black Elderberry Syrup is suitable for everyday use for the whole family. This popular formula is USDA Certified Organic and made with only organic black elderberries. Ideal for both daily and seasonal immune support, our Black Elderberry Syrup is a delicious and potent way to maintain your child's immune health all year long.\n Elderberries have been traditionally used for functions of the gastrointestinal tract, supporting a healthy body temperature and perspiration during an acute immune challenge, and for supporting the resilience of the body throughout the difficult winter months. Both elderflower and elderberry are rich in polyphenols, which have antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress is often produced during an immune response, and having sufficient antioxidant storage in the body may help to maintain the health and integrity of tissues. \n From seed to shelf, Gaia is deeply committed to the purity, integrity, and potency of each product. Since Gaia Herbs was just a seedling in 1987, we have focused on connecting people, plants, and the planet to create healing. We use only organic methods to cultivate more than 6.5 million plants each year. That same organic approach continues throughout our manufacturing. We use patented technology to achieve the highest efficacy of each herb.\n We are a company devoted to transparency. We have created a Gaia\u2019s MeetYourHerbs platform, one of the world\u2019s first and only herb traceability programs, allowing consumers to learn about and engage with their organic herbs. We are able to source premium ingredients so you always know what's in your supplement. \n As a Certified B Corporation, we are actively working toward building a more inclusive and sustainable world. We nurture healthy connections between plants and people by encouraging strong relationships and championing environmental sustainability within the communities that we work with around the world.",

Native Americans in California prized them as a source of food and for the oil that could be extracted from the plant. Eschscholzia californica was the first named member of the genus Eschscholzia, which was named by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso after the Baltic German botanist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, his friend and colleague on Otto von Kotzebue\u2019s scientific expedition to California and the greater Pacific in mid-1810s aboard the Russian ship Rurik.",

California Poppy Herb, or Eschscholzia californica, consists of the parts of the plant that grow above the ground, i.e., the leaves, stems and petals. These bulk herbs (which are really leaves and petals) are then dried and can be used as an infusion (as in tea) or an herbal tincture. A perennial native to the interior valleys of southern Oregon and California and ranging into the deserts of Nevada and Arizona, bulk California Poppy Herb has been used for several thousands of years by the Yokut and Pima Indians for its mildly sedative properties.
