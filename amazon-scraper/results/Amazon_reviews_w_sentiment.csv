I was prescribed a mild dose of Xanax to help because I have reoccurring stress dreams all night long that prevent me from getting good sleep. I wasn't comfortable with that so I started checking around and found this. I have been using it for only 1 week but I really notice a difference. I haven't taken the anti anxiety med or melatonin (another failed attempt) and I feel pretty good. I track my sleep with a Jawbone device and this has added at least 2 additional hours of solid sleep to my night. The dreams are lucid but not too crazy and it's a nice break from the usual 'I'm behind on this and it needs to be done now!' dreams. I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off. I don't even notice that part, I just realize at the end of the day the job seamed easier.

As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal.

However I do notice that when I take it I sleep for a little longer than normal. Sometimes it makes me feel sleepy and I yawn but other times it just knocks me out and so I only take it a little before bedtime. This is a sedative so use with caution. And consult with your doctor before taking. I got this because it said it would help with early morning awakenings. At least that is what the magazine article said. Sometimes I awaken in the middle of the night but usually can easily get back to sleep.

This is when I realised the product was making me feel worse.Be mindful of your dosage and keep track your symptoms.

In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.  Some I don't have an alternative and will use the entire amount without other brands in the mix.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KIbPz5ZJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tiyTvNPmL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OTX-E2AfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t+QesskGL._AC_.jpg,0.06,0.84,0.101,0.9578,positive,neutral

Look no further for a healthy natural and organic sleep aid. Effective, Taste Good, High Quality, Reasonable Price, and the company selling it seems ethical. Great energy. I wish this would come up when people searched sleep aid on Amazon, but unfortunately right now you need to search pretty specifically to find it.Read full review for more details.-I have had sleep issues since I was a teenager (30s now). A long time ago I took Ambien, but later switched to herbal remedies to get away from the dangers and downsides of that medication. I've tried everything I think is available such as; Catnip, Chamomile, Valerian, and California Poppy, various tinctures, teas, and pills containing them or other relaxing plants over the years.Out of them I found Valerian and Poppy to be the most effective on separate occasions (don't underestimate a strong Catnip tea though), but I had never tried them together so I ordered this product. It is very effective as expected, though with my sleep issues I do sometimes need more than the recommended .75ml. That's okay, it's a large bottle and at a price I find acceptable for such a high quality product. We'll see how long it lasts and I'll update the review, but based on my math it should last about 3 months taking a double dose, 6 months if you have only mild sleep trouble or are tiny like my partner.Oh, and, if you are aware that Poppy and Valerian both taste or smell awful - forget about it. This tincture tastes amazing. I have been baffled at how that's possible, maybe the glycerine base makes that big of a difference? However it happened, I actually ENJOY the taste of this, so there isn't the slightest resistance to taking it.I have a feeling this product will be on my nightstand for a long time, until I have the equipment to easily make a homemade vegetable glycerine tincture like this.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31FLWNq2vUL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLu6PAGEL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xipiTZxrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bNmU4CB5L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mglMM3cvL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Zi+yKEzWS._AC_.jpg,0.058,0.76,0.182,0.992,positive,positive

(Note - This Is Not For Pain)",tensor(5.),"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015",tensor(True),"I feel I have to leave a review here to give more of a balanced perspective on this product instead of the other reviews you're likely seeing from people that didn't do a whole lot of research before buying this product.TL:DR - Use this for relaxation and sleep. It's not an instant drowsiness but rather it feels as if you're naturally progressing towards sleep over 30-60min. DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT. Take it with something sweet like orange juice. 15-20 drops outta do it. Also, the effects take longer to kick in if you take this and then continue to stare at a TV or computer screen.Detailed Background: My curiosity around California Poppy Seed Extract (CPSE) came from Tim Ferriss and his findings in The 4 Hour Body. There seemed to be some evidence that CPSE has some benefits around REM sleep. As someone who has trouble sleeping and wants to reduce the amount of sleep I need every day, this piqued my interest. So I went online, looked through a few academic papers, and pestered a few relatives that were pharmacists and doctors about this. Turns out, Tim's findings do hold some weight (although more rigorous studies and testing are definitely needed).I've been using this product for about 2-3 years now and I haven't had any issues. To be safe, I took Tim's advice and I stop taking this every three months for the duration of one month. And I've gone from using this every night to maybe 2-3 times a week and that's typically if I know I'm not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. The boost to REM sleep definitely helps.I think one of the biggest takeaways is this isn't, at least in my case, an addictive substance and it doesn't have seem to have any significant side effects (unlike many major pharmaceutical products). If anything, it helped to train my body to get a regular sleep cycle and how to relax before bed. So that, even when I stop taking this for a month at a time, I still get a decent amount of sleep.So in short, the product works if you use it as intended. If you did zero research and you're going off the claims of Dr.Oz...frankly...you're kind of an idiot. Never trust one source, especially a celebrity. This doesn't magically cure pain. At least to my knowledge, I've never experienced it or come across any research that indicates that unless it's a placebo effect.Use this for sleep and relaxation, that's all. And if you want more info or struggle with either of those topics then I'd recommend taking a look through The 4 Hour Body. Several other tips there that have helped me out over the years.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31OtQndo79L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/316CMENJCPL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31BtWrlD+sL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xEFBKeZML._AC_.jpg,0.054,0.845,0.101,0.9748,positive,neutral

I don't have issues falling asleep, but I do notice now that something about DreamOn Zen helped make me feel sleepier and go to sleep faster.My new plan is to take one dose of this plus one dose of DreamOn Zen instead of two doses of either one separately.So if your brain situation sounds like mine, try this.

As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.

Just send me a little bit more of the thing I actually wanted to get from you, instead of a massive sample of something else.

Normally, I’d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different—a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I’d heard these were supposed to be nature’s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn’t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity—who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I’m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I’d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn’t feel groggy or out of it—just calm, focused, and oddly energized.

Just so happens I'm taking this right now as I'm writing this review. A couple months ago I had originally bought the same exact tincture and brand at a holistic store located four hours from where I live. I don’t travel as often as I would like and so I ended up ordering this brand from amazon. Typically I just squirt this stuff into my cup of water.I've read how well ashwagandha works on improving energy and dismissing stress which was a major reason for me to try this. I'm glad I did. Something to keep in mind is, most herbs take a couple of weeks to a month to start affecting the human body. Depends on who you are, sometimes the effects are faster and sometimes it might take longer. Sometimes a different plant might work better. So keep experimenting.In my case, I started seeing the results I was looking for within two weeks. I’m taking fewer naps because I have more energy to use. I’ve actually been taking this for months now and a few weeks ago I started a second job. I’m a big sap because I have a very low tolerance to stress. Working two jobs is something I never imagined I could do because of my low stress tolerance. And yet here I am, just passing my second week with keeping two jobs and there’s still some energy to spare. I’m very surprised to feel only a minimum of stress. It’s very insignificant especially compared to where I originally was and that was when I had only one job. Now I’m often working double shifts a day and I’m feeling pretty good. I still get an occasional bout of anxiety, usually when I forget to take the ashwaganda, but it’s not nearly as often or as crippling as it has been in the past.As a little side note, I have depression and anxiety and I often feel as if I’m in a mental fog. Within just minutes of taking it I feel as if the fog has lifted. Lately I’ve been able to think clearer and with a little more focus. A pleasant surprise considering it took a couple of weeks to finally see an increase in energy.I love it, and I plan with continuing to purchase this tincture.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41mHIWyk-lL._AC_.jpg,0.053,0.848,0.1,0.9424,positive,positive

A few months ago it was a lifesaver. So much so that I spent $100+ this time around to get two 4 oz Red Root tinctures and two 4oz Astragalus tinctures. I overlooked the first mishap during my first reorder when they sent me two glycerine-based Red Root tinctures instead of the alcohol-based tinctures I had ordered. But the second mishap is irredeemable, as I have been sent an unusable product with diluted health benefits.I was suspicious when I opened the Astragalus (first time ordering), since it was much lighter and strikingly clearer than past Astragalus tinctures I have taken. It also did not have that signature, and unmistakable, Astragalus scent. However, when I opened the Red Root, my heart sank, because I knew then the worthlessness of what I'd received. When I first ordered this product, the Red Root was a vibrant deep, rich red color and an extremely strong extraction. Now, it is indistinguishable from water...even the ""alcohol"" content appears to be much less than the bottle states, as the taste is more watery than anything else--certainly a far cry from what I'd first ordered. I've uploaded a photo of what the new tincture alongside the little bit I have left of the glycerine-based tincture (photos taken in the same place at the same time of day). There is zero chance that it holds anything close to the amount of plant material it claims to hold on the bottle. And the health benefits I've received from this new batch are zero to none, which is the hardest part to face about this.

My doctor finally tapered me down to a minuscule does of a benzo that I was on for a year before a new doctor tapered me off completely. I’ve been benzo free for months and not okay. My anxiety is getting better because I’m finally learning to cope through the situational anxiety, however, even when I’m not faced with those situations my anxiety arises. I’m easily startled, my heart jumps, and it’s just something I’ve learned to live with without benzos. I’m on an antidepressant that was given to help with the anxiety. Does it help? I don’t think so because I still have pretty bad anxiety. I tried every herb and natural remedy you can think of. Finally, I found a CBD tincture that contained lavender oil. For the first time ever, it soothed my anxiety just like a benzo. I was amazed because cbd never worked for me. After some homeopathic experimentation I’ve found that it was the lavender oil ( not cbd) that made me feel anxiety free.

In the hope of helping others who may be looking for a substitute for their favorite hop-based cold beverage, I have edited the review to eliminate any mention of the beverage's name. I was not aware that this beverage was inappropriate to discuss, since I see it on the shelves in family-friendly places in my very conservative home town. Maybe there is some other problem with my review. Anyway, here goes.My husband and I joke about inventing a dehydrated brew to carry on our wilderness backpacking trips. I bought this extract and Alka-Seltzer Gold, hoping to come up with a recipe that would combine the fizz, the hop flavor, and a cup of spring water into an acceptable beverage.I tried several combinations of water, Alka-Seltzer and hops. Finally one effort produced something that didn't leave me wanting to rinse my mouth, but it wasn't good enough to finish the glass. No way would I carry the extra few ounces to drink it.When added to a cup of herbal tea, this adds a relaxing quality and the bitter flavor is not unpleasant. For now I'll enjoy it that way, until I find a portable lightweight solution to the need for carbonation.

It’s fairly easy to take (2 dropperfuls once to three times a day) but it’s hard for me to get a “full” dropper.  It fills up about 3/4 of the way no matter how I angle the bottle and position the dropper.  And there’s no line or indicator to show how full it needs to be.  However, since they say you can take it up to 3x a day I guess you don’t have to be too cautious about overdosing.  The taste is also a little strong for me personally — the thyme really is prominent in this.  I am used to herbal supplements and normally don’t have any issues with weird concoctions but with this one I’d have to get used to it.  I was able to do one dropper of it without mixing into anything but I think I’ll try hiding it in a tart juice, but it’s such a strange combination of flavors I’m not sure I could stand drinking it in a full cup of juice.  In a pinch I would use this but I think I’d prefer a pill or just a simple elderberry gummy instead.  Just my preference anyway.

The bottle includes an eye dropper cap that is used to deliver the recommended 2 dropper full of the liquid. The ingredients includes extracts of echinacea, elderberry, thyme, sage, yarrow, and lemon balm in a proprietary combination. The claim is that this tincture will support a healthy immune system and provide a defense against seasonal threats that can make you ill, per the product description. I'm familiar with all the ingredients, but feel that there are minerals and vitamins that should be added to the mix to boost immunity. The liquid tastes quite bad so I recommend adding the 2 dropper full to some juice. I appreciate that it's made in the USA. I find the price point for 20 days supply to be rather steep.

I've been taking them like I normally would, but it's just...odd, because I know they're not supposed to look like this (unless they've changed?). I will still order these, I'm just confused. Hopefully I won't get sick or anything, I have 34 capsules left and I take two every morning.UPDATE: 6/12/17So I ordered another bottle a few days ago and received the bottle, to which on the box it stated that it was a new and improved formula. The capsules looked exactly like the ones that inspired me to write this review, they looked like the capsules in the picture. So the company finally got around to making it official that they changed the formula, on the box. I can't say for sure if this new formula works better than the old one, as I was sure that they were onto something with the liquid inside the capsule. Oh well. I ordered the elderberry syrup as well (not the nighttime one) and I take that sometimes when I need the extra help and want the benefits of having the liquid. So I guess just be aware that there's the change to the formula. Too bad they couldn't have just made another version of this capsule and kept this one with liquid inside.

The liquid works better and faster than pill form. I was so thrilled to fund some affordable ones on amazon because it's difficult to justify a trip to sprouts for just one item and I have 2 small kids to tote around. This is a great quality product. It doesn't habe the alcohol burn like some Valerian liquids do. It does taste terrible when you first use it, but it doesn't really bother me. You kinda ha e to experiment with how much you need, I usually use about 1/4 to 1/2 of the dropper to get the effect I want.  This is also good for headaches and for relaxing as well. It works well for me as a sleep aid. I take it 30 minutes before I intend to go to sleep and it works amazingly!  No groggy feeling in the morning unless I took too much, but it's not like taking a sleeping pill or benadryl sort of groggy. I've never missed my alarm or slept til noon with this. Like I said experiment with how much you need. A while dropper full was too much for me and I'm slim,  5'6, in my mid 30s, for a reference, if size plays a part or just show tolerant you are with sleep aids.  Hope this helps!

I can't say that I noticed any difference while taking it myself. Fast forward a few months and someone I know was diagnosed with Lyme and asked me for some herbal recommendations. Amazon was out of the Montana Farmacy brand at that time so I searched and found this one instead. It's made in the USA and 3rd party lab tested so I felt that it was safe to try. This person had a definite herx reaction from taking this Cryptolepis.  The Lyme literate doctor that they see felt that this was a very positive sign that the Cryptolepis was working.I decided to try this brand myself and I can definitely tell that it's stronger and making a difference. It has a 1:3 menstruum ratio vs the 1:5 ratio of Montana Farmacy.  I noticed an increase in fatigue with this brand at first as it started fighting the Lyme bacteria. Now that I've been taking it for a few weeks, I'm feeling noticeably better and more energized even with a low dose.I've also recommended this brand to a second person with Lyme Disease and other coinfections. They were taking a different Cryptolepis and they feel that Secrects of the Tribe Cryptolepis is much better than what they were taking previously.I highly recommend giving this product a try if you're considering it. Just be careful not to take too much at first because it's strong stuff.

As someone who has been on many medications over the years with often negative repercussions I’m very much for the natural approach of diet, exercise, Therapy, and supplements.This is not my first herbpharm  tincture I first bought the chamomile and lemonbalm. I was already comfortable using this when I bought it I just didn’t realize how amazing it was for anxiety until recently when I started having crippling panic attacks again at the end of February. As someone who took Clonopin for more than six years, and then had to spend a year withdrawing and coming off of it I have to say this tincture gives me just as much relief. Without any of the side effects of withdrawal symptoms. That’s enough to be a win in my book. It’s reasonably priced it lasts a fairly long time you can also buy a 4 ounce bottle which I love as an option. I’ve known about this for years and like I said I’ve used some of the other ones I have for sleep and for anxiety this has worked the best for me however I’ve known about this for years and like I said I’ve used some of the other ones I have for sleep and for anxiety this has worked the best for me however.

Everyone is different And is affected differently so that’s important to keep in mind. It sucks to see the reviews bad mouthing these herb farm products for potency and what not.

Within 2 weeks of twice daily usage they disappeared, yippee! As a side bonus, with continued use, it also seems to have taken care of heart palpitations I used to get around 3 am.m, upon waking and randomly during the day. My doc doesnt seem to think this is a normal response, but I will take it! I used 2 droppers 2x daily to have this effect, and the 4 oz bottle lasts me about a month at this dosage.Unfortunately I did not have as good luck with it helping my insomnia. I use 2 droppers ? ~40 drops at bedtime. Maybe more would show a benefit.As a side note, the extract works much better for me than taking capsules, even if I take the capsules apart and take the powder in some water.UPDATE Dec2014 - I found if I take 6 droppers half full at bedtime it works great on my insomnia.

The quality of Herb Pharm is the BEST!!  Using this along with Crampbark by Herb Pharm, I have completely stopped using OTC pain medicine for everything.  The combination of the two can beat any pain that I've had...other than the nerve pain associated with my herniated disk.  It has worked for headaches, menstrual cramps, spastic colon/IBS...and on most of my back and joint pain.  It does not make me tired but does make me more relaxed.  The taste is not a problem.UPDATE: I have discovered Jamaica Dogwood from Herb Pharm and I highly suggest it to all pain sufferers!!! I combine it with cramp bark for severe pain. I still use the Skullcap...but more for pain when I'm trying to relax or sleep...or just to relax. Jamaica Dogwood works on all pain including nerve pain. I finally can live pain-free with my herniated disk. When I recently started to get a flair up of sciatica (caused by herniated disk), I combined it with willow bark also from Herb Pharm, which is an anti-inflammatory (not to be used with any NSAIDs), which caused my sciatica to almost completely go away in 1 hour of taking the first dose. With in 4 days of using the combination my sciatica was GONE...instead of 30 chiropractor visits and tons of physical therapy which used to take up to 4 months to heal.

And ooohhh man does the anxiety just get worse over time. Over longer periods of stress, certain minerals in your body can be depleted, leaving you more and more anxious and stressed out. Obviously mineral replenishment and the restoration of adrenal function is your end goal, but that takes time.In the meantime, I've found that a few drops of skullcap when I've stressed out helps take the edge off. As with anything, overuse can be problematic and have side effects. But a few drops of this helps calm me temporarily. It's not going to have prescription strength powers..... but it'll be safer and have fewer side effects and issues on your overall bodily symptoms if you have milder bouts of anxiety.I also like to use this before bedtime to help calm my racing mind and get to sleep. My preference is valerian, but using that too frequently can cause it to use it's effectiveness. So I like to alternate out between skullcap and valerian, combined with hops, to actually get a good nights sleep. Enough sleep can help your body better manage your cortisol levels (created as a response to stress).

What a night!  I took it to help with sleep and pain.  I will say that it most definitely made me sleepy and I did find it calming.  However, for me it appears to be dangerous.  I woke up a couple hours after taking it.  I saw lights on under the bedroom doors (one leads to a hall and one to a laundry room).  It took me a long time to figure out where I was in the room.  I knew I was in the room in the bed, but didn't know where in the room the bed was located.  I then realized that I was upside down and half-off the mattress.  Not at all like me, I don't move much.  I got up and went to the bathroom and when I came back the lights under the door were not on.  I asked my husband who was in the basement playing a computer game and he said no lights were on to his knowledge.  So I don't know what happened!  I think I was half-asleep when I got up.  I ended up sleeping until 9 this morning but I have been groggy all day.  I should note that I am very sensitive to medications so it stands to reason that I would be with herbs as well.  But after reading about some issues with Skullcap and possible liver problems, I'm going to discontinue it.  Tonight I'm trying the Jamaican Dogwood.  I'll post about that one tomorrow.  By the way, I love Herb Pharm and have not been sick all year, which I believe is due to using their Mullein Blend.

I've purchased different brands, I make my own alcohol-based tinctures using all sorts of herbs.  This product tastes exactly like an alcohol-based tincture with material from the earth, exactly what you'd expect a medicinal herbal to taste like.  It has no fillers, no preservatives, no taste enhancers like commercial cough syrup made to taste like cherry to accommodate the finicky consumer.  People writing reviews that says, it tastes awful, it made them ""puke"" are probably not accustomed to taking botanical tinctures.  There is NOTHING, absolutely nothing about this tincture that differentiates it from most other herbal tinctures.  If you want bad taste, try sage or valerian in a tincture.  If you never smelled valerian, give it a go then smell this.  Based on the reviews, I thought that the mushrooms might have exceptionally bad taste profile different from other tinctures.  No, it smells and tastes like alcohol because it's 30-40% alcohol, with raw mushrooms from the earth.  I can't say it tastes good, nor can I say it tastes bad.  Those are very subjective  reviews based on your experience and tolerance for taking medicinal botanicals.  There is no foul odor compared to other herbals, but not as nice as something like elderberry.  It is what it is.  You're taking a medicine designed to heal your body.  If you're a lush, you'll have no problems.  The fact that you personally can't tolerate the taste is not a reflection of the product.  It would be reasonable to say, I didn't tolerate the taste but it's stretch to say it tastes like anything other than what it is.  REvise your expectations if you're not experienced at taking herbal tinctures with alcohol and ensure when you review it you tell others that it might have more to do with you then the actual product.  You might want to find a product with vegetable glycerin because it's sweeter and will mask the musty, earth flavor of the mushrooms.  It is what it is and it wouldn't be worthwhile if it tasted like cotton candy.

Coincidence? Maybe.  But he thinks not.  Also, a relative of mine takes cordyceps and reishi, and is recovering from COPD.  He has been interviewed about this, and has been able to reduce his asthma treatments to just a couple a day from what I understand.  He's had asthma since he was a child, he's now over 60, was severely overweight for many years.  Between a massive weight loss and this stuff, and now being able to exercise, he is getting his life back. He recently walked across the province of New Brunswick in Sept of 2019. Google him.

I decided to try the liquid and this particular Tincture (mixed with a little alcohol). It's easy to administer, the package says 4 drops a day (or 4 ml), which means this bottle should last 15 days.  However, in the product description, it says to use 2 drops, which means the bottle will last 30 days. Based on my research, I suggest going with 1 or 2 drops a day so that one can analyze if there are any side effects and act accordingly. Once you assess the situation you can probably increase the dosage (or even stop it completely). I'm starting with 2 drops personally and am interested to see if it will affect blood sugar and cholesterol/triglycerides.I didn't taste the drops on their own, but I added them to my tea, I didn't notice any change in taste, though again I'm using 2 drops, so I'm not sure if there will be a difference if one uses 4 drops.

Includes a dropper (instead of a cap) and measurements up to 1ml so it is very easy to use and get the correct dosage. I'm a firm believer in natural products and using nature to not only sustain us but to repair us as well.It tastes surprisingly pleasant and while I add it to my morning coffee I wanted to know what the actual taste was on it's own and I'm happy to say it's tasty as well as a very light translucent golden colour. Adding it to my morning coffee the taste gets lost so I really don't notice its there.Promotes Better Immune System (which we all want) and Stress Response for a natural calm which in the busy season is a sure blessing! A win win in my book.I'm a little confused as to the dosage as the description says to take 2 dropper full's and each dropper holds 1ml so that would be 2ml. Yet the box it comes in says to take 4ml per adult dosage. And the bottle itself mentions a 4ml serving? So if I take 4ml per serving I would only get 15 servings per bottle. By taking 2ml per serving I will get 30 servings per bottle and if I only want to take 1ml per serving which for me seems reasonable I will get 60 servings so a 2 months supply. Anyhow which ever serving size you prefer to take I believe it will be helpful.I have a strong and healthy immune system as but the stress response for a natural calm is good as my husband says I'm grumpy before I get my coffee and as it goes in my coffee it's a win for both of us. I'm not so young anymore and finding something like this to help keep me calm, relaxed and healthy is great! Love it!Only time will tell as to the overall effect this will have on me and everything responds differently to different folks.

After consulting with my pain doc, I upped the dose.  2 at bedtime, 1 or 2 in the A.M., and 1 or 2 in the late afternoon.  They are NOT a miracle.  They have become an important part of my pain treatment plan.  Give them a good trial by using them on schedule,  for the whole first bottle.  Honestly, I panic if my supply is low.  As, far as dosage, start on a Friday night and see if they make you drowsy during the day on Saturday and Sunday ... Add a day dose during the next weekend.

First try: I was wired (brain rushing for no clear reason) and one capsule did help me relax in about 30 minutes, but it was right after a hot shower, which is also calming.Second time I tried this I was agitated and stressed. It helped, but not quickly. Two hours later I was depressed, but I doubt it had anything to do with the supplement. Likely just an off day for me.Third try, I took this around 5 pm for agitation. It helped a little bit, but slowly. However, I slept very well that night, better than expected.Poppy is believed to act on GABA receptors, which calm your central nervous system. Research is limited on California Poppy, but 250 mg (one of these capsules) might be a low dose. I’m not recommending you take more but, if results are lacking, dosage may be the reason.

I am coming close to attributing this as assuredly contributing but I  can't necessarily attribute just this as I've been taking several sleep aids off and on.  No side effects.  A couple of the other multi ingredient sleep aids also include less California Poppy and when using those I don't take this.  In general my goal has been more and better sleep and I'm finding that from a couple mixed ingredient sleep aids now so I'm not experimenting with this supplement much now that I've found the others.  Will probably experiment more with it later and update.Pros:I feel more calm and am getting better quality of sleep for what little I usually get.Value for 60days under $10.ConsNone noted.ABOUT ME AND SUPPLEMENTS:Supplements are sometimes easy to attribute a positive or negative though mostly they aren't attributable over months if ever.  I will try my best to review on what I see if I do and update if I find a change.  Supplements I'm generally not overjoyed with or that I have faith in the quality of as well as how economical they are to continue - I will not take past the bottle I'm using and thus won't update unless I revisit this not likely any time soon.I have been taking numerous supplements for decades and several more for many years.  Lately I have started some new supplements mixing in with existing.  I favor simple supplements with one or a few active ingredients that way I can decide how much of what I am taking.  In general supplements with tons of ingredients and especially ones that are aimed at one thing yet contain numerous supplements with little to no added benefits are worrisome.  I do not need (for example) to worry about getting 100 or 400 (whatever) each times the B vitamins needed in a day from five or ten or more different supplements.In experimenting I am usually taking for days or weeks some supplements then switching for a different brands equivalent noting differences if any.

Normally, I’d tackle this chore with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on a hot day, but tonight, I had something different—a bottle of natural wild lettuce and California poppyseed extracts supplements. I’d heard these were supposed to be nature’s way of telling your body to chill out, so I decided to give them a whirl. I took a dose and braced myself for the inevitable laundry battle. As I started folding clothes, I noticed my usual end-of-week tension was melting away like butter on a hot skillet. The wild lettuce and poppyseeds were kicking in, and instead of dreading the task, I found myself humming along to a playlist I hadn’t paid attention to in ages. By the time I reached the bottom of the laundry basket, I was in full-on zen mode. The mundane had somehow transformed into a surprisingly enjoyable activity—who knew folding socks could feel this good? With my newfound sense of calm, I decided to take things up a notch. I dimmed the lights, brewed some herbal tea, and settled into my favorite chair with a book that had been collecting dust for way too long. Usually, my mind would wander after a few pages, but not tonight. The world around me seemed to slow down, and I got lost in the story, feeling more present and relaxed than I had in weeks. But the real magic happened when I finally hit the sack. I’m not exaggerating when I say I drifted off to sleep like a feather floating on a gentle breeze. No tossing, no turning, just a deep, restful sleep that left me feeling like I’d hit the reset button on my body and mind. The next day, I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the weekend. And the best part? I didn’t feel groggy or out of it—just calm, focused, and oddly energized.

I don't wake up groggy and I can use it throughout the day for general anxiety and It doesn't  do anything but take the edge off.

As others have stated in the reviews here - every person is unique, and no two people will experience the same effects.  With this in mind I read all the reviews and saw that people either had a good result or very little result and thought I'd try it for my severe chronic insomnia and see if it helped me.  After laying awake for 4 hours I took it (exactly as the label instructs) at 2:45am.  When I was still awake an hour later and got up to use the bathroom I was very startled to find I suddenly had severe double vision and a really unpleasant sensation in the front of my head.  After returning to bed I essentially blacked out for about 45 minutes and then snapped wide awake (where I stayed the rest of the night).  Fortunately for me the double vision passed in about 3 more hours.  I spent the next day with a headache and the realization that supplements like this are completely unregulated and I had NO IDEA what I had actually consumed when I took this product. The ingredients indicated on the label are ""Alcohol 62%"" and distilled water.  Perhaps it's wood alcohol? That might explain the bad visual disturbance and unpleasant headache.  I'm thankful my vision returned to normal the next day, as I could've experienced permanent damage from consuming a liquid made and sold by an unknown entity in an industry that has zero oversight.  Final word on this stuff: take at your own risk.  If the severe visual disturbance I experienced from it hadn't passed... I hate to imagine.  And 45 minutes of sleep for the night wasn't my goal. I threw the bottle in the trash the next day.

I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money. It had a strong, bitter alcohol taste (considering it is mixed with alcohol) that was difficult to mask, even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea. Since I use herbal extracts to relax, I am always on the lookout for new, helpful herbal remedies. For instance, I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective. After reading about California poppy being a relaxant, pain reliever, etc. I had pretty high expectations. I have to say I was disappointed. Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed, and even so, it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower. I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams, and it did nothing for pain.

It was diluted, of course.  It worked better than anything else I used at the time.  Then they seemed to have stopped making it.  I have missed that.  This, however, is a close second!HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a bottle which is glass, not plastic.  I am partial to those.CAPSULESThese are pressed pills with a dividing line down the center if you want to cut them in half.  They break easily.CONTENTSI love what is in these, but did want to point out that sometimes certain herbs will register positive on drug tests.  I know of some people who ate poppy seed cookies or cakes that had false positives, so check on that prior to using these if that is a concern to you.  Otherwise the ingredients in this are pretty nice.SMELL/FLAVORThis has lavender in it.  I do occasionally burp up lavender after taking with a meal.  I love it so it does not bother me.  It might bother some people.DIGESTIONI had no issues with digestion other than occasional burps with lavender usually only once and that is it.DO THEY WORK?I must say these do seem to work well to not only help me sleep , but help me go back to sleep even after having to go to the bathroom at night.GROGGY?I don't feel groggy when I wake up, but I do feel rested.THE BOTTOM LINEI like these a lot.

Unfortunately this product missed the mark. First red flag was the proprietary blend. For those who do not know, manufacturers use ""proprietary blends"" as a way of preventing someone else from reformulating their product by showing the ingredients but hiding the amounts of each. This is bad news in the supplement world for a couple of reasons: 1) you don't know how much of each ingredient you are getting, so there is no telling if you are getting a very underdosed or overdosed amount of any particular ingredient, and 2) because you do not know how much you are getting of each ingredient, you don't know if you are getting ripped off or not. This product is quite expensive at $36 before tax. You can deduce that the combined total of all these ingredients in the proprietary blend are less than half thanks to the disclosure of 48-53% alcohol which leads me to the next red flag.To help with this perspective, this product is ""96-106 proof."" Sure, the serving size is quite low, but alcohol is known to be neurotoxic and deleterious to sleep. Definitely not something I want to see in a sleep/relaxation product. But at least you might be able to take comfort in that this won't likely be abused for its alcohol content as the taste is unbearable.I really can get past things that are not the best taste if it means I am getting something of great benefit to my health. However, you almost cannot use this product after you try it for the first time because of how of putting the taste is.I wish I had one thing good to say, but they made it really hard. The branding of this product is enticing and creative maybe.But overall I think you are better of looking for something else at this price point.

He has always worked the late shift since he was 15 and recently got an early morning job, so his body isn't adjusting too well. Figuring that it was either the hops or the GABA in the beer that was making him drowsy, I tried making him some herbal tea blends with hops since I had some on-hand. It didn't do anything. So of course, to Amazon!I wasn't searching for a topical product but it aligned with his mentality that pills are bad, so I took a chance on it. Wowow this product W O R K S. Not just for my husband, but for me! I don't have trouble falling asleep, but I don't get good, deep sleep once I'm in that state. This cream fixes that issue completely! I feel so incredibly rested - provided I give myself time for 8 hours.I was sold on one reciew that mentioned they don't even remember falling asleep, and I must say that is exactly my experience as well! I started with 1 pump on my wrists and enjoyed the results, but the best rest comes from applying it to my temples! And I don't need very much when I apply it there compared to my wrists, so it's cost-saving too!If you are unsure on this one, I say take a chance.

I never have sleep problems but that night I had barely been in bed a few minutes before my lights went out and that was on half a dose. At the next opportunity I got brave and used a half dose in the middle of the day. It felt like i had a midday pause for a cup of tea! It did not make me sleepy but I did feel renewed and less stressed to continue the rest of the day.  From that point I experimented with dosing depending on how stressed I was feeling.I like the idea of a topical cream. I can keep it in my purse and not worry it's going to spill like liquid drops. HealthyGut products are non GMO, they have no fillers and they use a cGMP facility. However, I don't see information about 3rd party lab testing. In my opinion that is probably the most important certification. you can have. Lastly, unfortunately these supplements from Healthy Gut are very overpriced especially lacking some important certifications.  That really limits the customer base who will no doubt go elsewhere until they find an answer as the founders did in their 'story'. I am not so sure I will order this again but I can definitely recommend this ""Be Serene Cream""",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31xKAmIOwrL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412x3AqV7YL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4147slx3MNL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FTORDC0AL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AkHDhcBUL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511QXOYqjML._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nsXKWy1qL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41e5PeHkHYL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31TNcw6JZlL._AC_.jpg,0.04,0.787,0.173,0.9922,positive,neutral

It has a bold, flavorful taste and is made with high-quality organic ingredients such as poppy from California, blue vervain, tart cherry, elderberry, and hawthorn. It has a bold flavor that is described as sweet and fruity, with a mild cinnamon undertone. The supplement comes in a 4.07oz bottle and has 100 servings.Overall, the Apothekary Wine Down is a natural supplement that can help individuals unwind and prepare for a restful night's sleep. Its unique blend of herbal extracts and lack of common allergens make it an attractive option for those looking for a safe and effective way to relax and improve sleep quality.I have to admit that when I first heard about Apothekary Wine Down, I was a bit skeptical about its claims of being ""wine replacement"" and promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality. I've tried other supplements in the past that promised similar benefits, but ultimately fell short of delivering on their promises. However, after giving Wine Down a try for several nights in a row, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. I like the flavor and easy-to-take formula made it a breeze to incorporate into my bedtime routine, and I found myself feeling more relaxed and calm than usual. I noticed that I was sleeping better and waking up feeling more refreshed, which was a great bonus. While I still approach supplements with a healthy dose of skepticism, I have to say that Apothekary Wine Down has won me over - it's definitely a product that I would recommend to others looking for a natural way to unwind and improve their sleep. My only ""complaint"" is a steep price.

And this tincture, when it touches my tongue, spreads a wonderful taste over it- and a quick moment later, there is a slow burn that begins and remains for a bit after.Wine Down comes in a lovely dark white colored glass bottle (not see through, white glass) with a dropper attached to the cap. Both the bottle and dropper are glass and both, the very best quality. The directions tell you to squeeze one drop on or under the tongue and let sit for ten seconds. If you don't like the taste however, you can put it in a drink. You are told in these directions you can take this tincture up to four times a day.When I took Wine Down, I felt the effects quickly- within a couple minutes, and in all honesty, it does have a very good calming effect. It worked so well I took to taking it with me during the day and taking it when I needed to relax. I wouldn't  say Wine Down is terribly intense though, it's just something that actually helped me to relax- as if before I couldn't quote catch my breath and after- well, there was no longer that problem.Wine Down is something that I will definitely be using in the future, because, for me, there were so many positive effects- not only did the tincture relax me but when I took it before bed, it also helped to get me to sleep better- during my “wind down” time (and now this is my “Wine Down” time ;).I am really in love with this product, I don't go anywhere without it (just in case I need it) and have never been so happy to have chosen this product to review on Amazon as- it would have never been something that I tried on my own!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31esPkojpzL._AC_.jpg,0.031,0.772,0.197,0.9973,positive,positive

A long story short, I have been struggling with menopause, I’m sure a lot of other people are having a really hard time with it like I was, but none of my friends had it that bad. I was having a hot flash every 20 min. All day long. When I wasn’t having a hot flash, I was sweating even when it was cold out! I also was going through major depression, even though I never struggled with depression before! I lost my job because I was so depressed I didn’t get out of bed, I was so sweaty and miserable.. this is terrible to say, but there were days where I thought it would be easier to die! I never ever knew menopause could be so horrible. I looked up stuff everyday that might give me some relief.. I’m not sure if we can mention other products, but I got Menoease, which helped a lot with the hot flashes.. it took about 3 weeks to notice a difference. While looking things up everyday, I read that Schisandra can help with your mood, fatigue and hot flashes.. So I ordered my first bottle and took some as soon as it came.. within 3 days, I felt like a brand new person.. I’m not sure if it’s also helping with the hot flashes since I’m still taking Menoease.. but it is 100 percent helping with the depression and fatigue. I get out of bed every morning now, my mood is Good and I have energy!!! I’m on my second bottle of this Schisandra and I will make sure I never run out! I know every product doesn’t effect everyone the same! But, if you are depressed and always tired.. I would honestly give it a try! I noticed a little difference in just one day.. but in about 3 days I noticed a huge difference! I put two half droppers full in about 2 oz of orange juice every morning!!

Every year starting in August until the first hard freeze my symptoms are horrible here in Northeast Wisconsin. Itchy & watery eyes, itchy throat & roof of my mouth, sneezing constantly, stuffed up and running nose, congestion.I never had allergies as a kid, but in my late teens to early 20’s I started getting them really bad. I took all of the over the counter meds, Zyrtec, Claritin, you name it. Those products worked, but had side effects. The OTC meds dried out my mouth and sinuses so bad. I would get nosebleeds, be super drowsy or tired. And I have read other bad things about anti-histamines that they can cause dementia after taking them over many years.My father-in-law is a big believer in natural products so he recommended Allerplex to me in combination with Fermented Cod Liver Oil by Blue Ice.I am a skeptical person and thought there was no way something like this could work. I was so wrong. I have read many reviews of this product and some are correct when they say it takes some time to start working. I believe it has to build up in your system to start making a difference. So don’t take two pills and say it doesn’t work. The dosage I read works best is 6-12 daily.I started my regimen August 1st. In Wisconsin this is before ragweed pollen was peaking. I would take 3 Allerplex pills with breakfast and 2 Fermented Cod Liver oil pills by Blue Ice I would repeat that dosage for lunch for the first 2 weeks.I had zero allergy symptoms. Then the ragweed peaked around August 16th with a very high count for a few days. I had slightly itchy eyes in the morning with a sneeze here or there. But nothing major. Had to blow my nose a little more than usual for a few days. So I started taking 3 pills for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and then with a snack in the evening for a few days.My symptoms are gone again. It’s August 21st now, and for the last 3 days, not one sneeze. No itchy eyes, stuffy nose, etc.  Nothing!So I lowered my frequency again only taking 3 Allerplex in the morning and 2 fermented cod liver oil for the last 3-4 days. Still no symptoms.I monitor the pollen count daily. And it is very high for ragweed.I saw my neighbor outside when I got home from work today and she was sneezing. I asked her if it was allergies. She said they were horrible for her right now. And my symptoms are gone! Naturally I had to tell her about Allerplex! So amazing! Standard Process has really changed my life in such a wonderful way. I tell my wife that I have to tell the whole world about this product!Just remember, let this product work through your body for a couple weeks. It may not work overnight. But it has been a game changer for me. I will never by an OTC allergy pill for the rest of my life. No side effects whatsoever! How could you go wrong?One last statistic I read about Allerplex in conjunction with fermented cod liver oil is that this combination works for 95% of people. As bad as my allergies were before Allerplex and as good as I feel now, I truly believe it. Allerplex 6-12 daily, Fermented Cod Liver Oil 3-6 daily. Everyone is different so monitor your body cuz no one knows it better than you. If no symptoms take less. If symptoms are bad take a bit more.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ky6WFVE+L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SE7qnSdsL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41GF96a4QFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41W3JOSy9IL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Lzhq7mW7L._AC_.jpg,0.103,0.828,0.068,-0.9683,negative,negative

NO MORE SUFFERING!!!!!,tensor(5.),"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2014",tensor(True),"This product is a LIFE CHANGER!  I've had allergies my entire life. The past few years they have been so bad that I was in constant pain most of the year. No allergy medicine helped. I had intense pain behind my eyes, severe congestion that lead to daily migraines and jaw/teeth pain.  I went to a chiropractor a few months ago for a non-related issue and discussed my migraines and sever allergies to him. Much to my surprise he was able to literally cure my sinus/allergy issues simply by suggesting I start taking Allerplex.  The bottle says to take 3 per meal. He said I should just take 1 per meal (3x day). Immediately I started seeing and feeling results. I'm now down to ONE Allerplex a day and the chiropractor said I can probably eventually come off them for good because my system should stabilize and not over-react to allergens or even insect bites as drastically as it was.  Even more proof that this supplement works wonders - I got bit on my toe by a fire ant last week - in the past my entire foot would swell up so badly that I couldn't even get a shoe on. Now that I've been using Allerplex, the bit swelled up, but nothing more than like a mosquito bite. It did sting and was irritating for a few days, but, in comparison to how I used to react to one bite, that was minimal!!!!!!!  I can now mow my entire yard and there is no more suffering afterwards. I used to be so allergic to grass, dust, pollen that any time in my yard - especially mowing - would have me sick in bed the entire next day.  As I said, Allerplex is truly a life changer.

I always read reviews before purchasing on Amazon so I thought this might help someone who isn't convinced.  I purchased Congaplex a few years ago when a friend told me to use it for sinus issues...works like a charm when I feel a cold coming on.  I have always had sinus issues and then allergies to pollen/dust etc developed in my late 20's.  My 70 year old father has undergone 3 sinus surgery's in his lifetime (in fact I should buy him a bottle too!).  The reason for the background is that I feel i'm quite experienced when it comes to otc and prescription sinus medication, allergy meds, nasal irrigation, z packs, etc.So about a year ago I bought another bottle of congaplex and on a whim I read the reviews for Allerplex and bought a bottle.  It sat in my cupboard for the past year...I continued on my zyrtec and nasal sprays thinking this stuff really can't battle these springtime allergies.  About 8 weeks ago my nasal congestion was horrible...and I knew the instant my medication wore out...I couldn't breathe...so I got back on the nasal sprays...again I knew exactly when they wore out too.  Finally, I thought what the heck let's try the allerplex.  It really is amazing! no more nasal congestion!!! Funny I usually sneeze about 4 times around 10:30 in the morning and i'm fine the rest of the day. Plus I just read another review before writing this and they described their chronic watery eyes...I've always had that issue...EVERY spring...and completely forgot about it because I've had maybe one morning with watery eyes!  There are no side effects whatsoever.  I take 2 or 3 in the morning and 2 or 3 before bed.  If you have allergies give it a try...if it doesn't work you're out $30 but if it does...you'll be back for more, like me!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ky6WFVE+L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SE7qnSdsL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41GF96a4QFL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41W3JOSy9IL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Lzhq7mW7L._AC_.jpg,0.017,0.914,0.069,0.9366,positive,neutral

I did not want to go the ""shot route"" for expense and personal reasons and I could not be happier. At the recommendation of my chiropractor, I began using this product to assist in controlling my allergies. It works wonderfully and I feel confident in using it not only for the results but for the fact that it is natural and will not ruin my body like a chemical shot may/may not (don't want to get into politics here). Over the years, I have been able to lessen the doses I have to take and where I used to take many before/during/after mowing the lawn, playing baseball, or petting a cat, now I only have to take a few, if any, to control my symptoms. I don't believe I am growing out of my allergies, but I do believe that this product has helped my body to build up tolerances to the things that agitate my allergies (ragweed, hay, grass, pets, etc.). I now live comfortably with both a dog and cat and enjoy the outdoors when the weather is nice. I keep the Allerplex on hand just in case and have rarely had to use it this season. I find that a larger amount is needed in the begging of the season to help my body acclimate to the change in polen levels, but once that is over, I am usually good to go.

It was getting to the point that I could only sleep 4 hours at a time, plus still wake up in pain to drag around exhausted continuously no matter what I tried. I only take a capsule if I'm not working the next morning lest I oversleep. The capsules don't drug me to sleep but do let me relax and drift off. Also, I am aware that I dream more and get better quality sleep. I wake up feeling refreshed and able to accomplish the day's goals. I didn't get an okay from my doctor before trying these, but used myself as a guinea pig. I am not one bit sorry about that though I'm not advocating everyone do the same. Still, these seem gentle in their effect. I am happy I found them (did so because I'm a tea lover and saw this ingredient in multiple sleep teas).

Now, I'm no scientist, but I swear these little guys did something good for my brain. My focus felt sharper, especially on those crazy busy days when my to-do list was longer than a CVS receipt. Lion's Mane is supposed to be the brain's best friend, and coupled with the chill vibes from Ashwagandha, it's like a match made in gummy heaven.But wait, there's more! They're not just for the brainiacs out there. Some days, I swear they helped with my memory, giving me that extra edge when I needed to remember where I left my keys or the name of that movie from the '90s.And let's not forget about sleep quality. These gummies didn't exactly knock me out like a horse tranquilizer, but I did notice I slept a bit more soundly on the nights I took them. Maybe it's the Reishi mushroom doing its thing—I don't know, but I'll take it!Oh, and mood? Yeah, they get a gold star for that too. I felt like I had a little pep in my step, even on those gloomy Mondays when the coffee just wasn't cutting it.Now, let's address the elephant in the room—smell. Okay, I won't lie, when you first open the bottle, there's a bit of a funky mushroom smell. But don't let that scare you off! Once you pop one in your mouth, it's all sweet, fruity goodness.And did I mention they're gummies? Yeah, you heard that right. No pills to swallow here—just delicious, chewy goodness. Plus, they're low carb, so you can indulge without feeling guilty about it.Now, don't get me wrong, these gummies aren't some magic cure-all. Some days, I felt like Wonder Woman after taking them, and other days, not so much. But hey, they're just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to feeling your best.When I started to take these it gave me a minor headache (could be possible side effects).Overall, if you're looking for a fun and tasty way to give your brain, memory, sleep quality, mood, and energy a little boost, these gummies might just be worth a shot!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51J6FUjWfnL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZTxuwpChL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NdbuWyw+L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Kaj9crXJL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZiVwnXJcL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sDtHEEMNL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eI3rpSaqL._AC_.jpg,0.043,0.763,0.194,0.9969,positive,positive

I think they help minimally but nothing super noticeable. I have tried those greens powders and could not notice any difference. I will try to post an update as I have only been taking for a few days but I can honestly say I think this is a game changer for me. I noticed a difference ever since the first day. As many others have stated I found I can only take 1 of these and it needs to be very early in the morning like by 7:30/8am. The first day I took it at 10:30am and then forgot I took it. Later in the afternoon I noticed I was not feeling sluggish at all and actually the opposite then it dawned on me I had take this supplement. I was not able to sleep well that night just wide awake and mind buzzing. I took it early in the morning the next 2 days and sleep was better. I am going to take a break from it over the weekend and see if I feel any different. Also I will add that I am neurodivergent (I don't take medication for this) and I honestly feel like it helping me be more focused and actually able to complete tasks instead of having decision fatigue. I have been very productive the last few days and very good mood. I do get seasonal depression and the daylight is quickly fading here plus it has been overcast and rainy for several days now so normally I would be very lazy and no energy but that has not been the case since taking this supplement. So far I am incredibly impressed. I have always thought I had some hormonal imbalances or something making me have lower energy and the past year I have put on weight that's been very difficult to lose (once I hit 30 it really hit). I am really hoping that continuing this supplement will help keep me more active and being able to complete more projects and tasks which I normally struggle with. I'm also hoping with the increased energy it will help me lose the weight I have gained over the last year. I'll try to post an update in a few weeks but I definitely recommend giving this a try, so far I really like it! I think I actually could use a lower dose. I am curious to see long term if its something your body gets used to and you need more to be as effective or not.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416qIoehYdL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oN56G-UwL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGzi2vuCL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4165aKQtC3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wSHGxypKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417T8MnXS2L._AC_.jpg,0.075,0.744,0.181,0.9953,positive,positive

Pretty cool, subtle results",tensor(5.),"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2018",tensor(True),"I have used this product for about two weeks with subtle but good results. I take one capsule in the morning and on a few occasions I took a second capsule in the evening.  I have not tried two capsules at once and I’ll explain why further down.  For an understanding of my physiology and health, I eat very healthy (close to a paleo diet with a few changes) and I’m very active.  I take creatine and not on any health medication.  I also work and in school.This supplement has a subtle effect on me.  This does not have a strong or immediately noticeable result once taken.  However, I did notice an increase in stamina and less fatigue when I was doing fast, high incline, hiking (I would say results felt similar to creatine but much less effective).  I also felt it helped me feel less fatigued on a few days when I was getting less than my normal amount of sleep.  I would like to try this stuff on a night shift rotation but I haven’t had the chance yet.It is important to remember everyone’s physiology is different and other factors like diet and health will impact how a supplement will work for different people.  Not everyone is going to get the same result and that is not necessarily the fault of the product (or the person).  For me, I noticed a mild improvement in the stamina and reduced fatigue, but I didn’t notice until taking it for a few days.  I’m not sure if you need to build this up in the system for a few days for effectiveness but I’m trying to test that now and will update later if I have anything to add.I would caution that if you have a weak or sensitive stomach you should be cautious with Rhodiola Rosea Extract.  It doesn’t have a pleasant taste and even though it is in capsule form, it caused a little stomach gas for me on a few occasions and I could smell / taste it which is not pleasant. For this reason I never wanted to take more than one pill at a time.  I didn’t have this experience every time, but it happened at least half the time, on an empty stomach or with a meal.  Having said that, it is not terrible either and I would argue if you are burning the candle at both ends, this may be effective in helping you balance out.  I don’t feel I need this daily but would use building up for finals or as needed.Also, I did not notice cognitive benefits while taking this and studying.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416qIoehYdL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oN56G-UwL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGzi2vuCL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4165aKQtC3L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wSHGxypKL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417T8MnXS2L._AC_.jpg,0.061,0.82,0.119,0.9837,positive,positive

However, as a serotonin promoter, R. rosea shouldn't be taken with SSRIs, 5-htp, or L-theanine, because excessive serotonin can cause ""serotonin syndrome"", the effects of which are the opposite of what you want out of it, such as insomnia.  It also lowers blood pressure, a positive for some but not all, and slightly increases heart rate; however, huperzine A (a promoter of acetylcholine) does the opposite.

I have a 13 month old and well….. you get the picture. She’s at the age now to where she sleeps throughout the night but mamas still having a hard time getting a full nights sleep. I can’t even remember the last time I had an actual dream, I’d probably wake up scared if I did. For the last couple nights I’ve been taking 2 of these snooze pills an hour before bed time. The last two nights I closed my eyes, tossed and turned for about 20 minutes (amazing for me) and then I woke up to the baby crying in the morning. I actually slept throughout the night. I didn’t even wake up when my husband got up. He’s extremely quiet but I’m such a light sleeper. I woke up feeling good too. No grogginess. It was like I didn’t even take sleeping aids the night before. I would give these 5 stars but they’re really expensive. So, they get 4 stars due to being too pricy for most of us to afford. 3 capsules is the suggested amount to take. That means this $50 bottle would get you 20 nights of rest.

Yes - I didn't have to rush right to bed quite as quickly, but still - wow! Did I sleep well!The third night I tried it without a glass of wine. I fell asleep and stayed asleep. This stuff is great.Let me tell you what I've had to take to go to sleep before trying this Minding Down supplement:1) Qunol Sleep Support 5 in 12) 15 mg Melatonin3) CBD (which I quit taking two months ago)4) I sleep with several palm stones in my bed. I have to hold stones in my hands or I can't sleep (something to try if you're desperate to sleep, but can't. Try amethyst, rose quartz, malachite, or selenite.)5) Theta wave binaural sleep music6) A humidifierNow it's just Minding Down and the palm stones (and the music and the humidifier - gotta have those).

I did however notice that after a few days of use it doesn't work as well as the initial use.  Gradually it becomes ineffective and you get no benefit from it.  If you stop using it for a few days and then try again it will work.This is most effective when used occasionally and not on a daily basis.  Your body will build a tolerance for it and it will not work after a week or two of daily use.  Once every 3 days seems to be the threshold for keeping it effective for myself.  You may find that it works differently for you.I do recommend this.  It did help me sleep well and continues to do so as long as I don't use it daily and only use it occasionally.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31G+9On6NpL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31LXv1UpUcL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31gwH2Mtf6L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zCvqfC-KL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rkcEct9oL._AC_.jpg,0.048,0.837,0.115,0.8979,positive,neutral

I wanted to try the extra strength version that the store didn't carry and decided to get the variety pack here. I'll return with my thoughts on each flavor as I try them but wanted to go ahead and leave my feedback because I've loved my experience so far.🌙Nighty Night: A very full tea with a delicious and refreshing minty lilt. Drinking this tea is one of the few things I look forward to eveyday and while it doesn't have a sleepy affect it does work well to calm my nerves before bed.💤Nighty Night Extra: Very similar to Nighty Night but also contains valerian root. Valerian root has a very distinct and rather unpleasant smell but it's flavor isn't unpleasant, it reminds me of dandelion tea. Extra had a bit more body than regular Nighty Night and had the same affect on my sleepiness.🍃Lavender mint: This makes me feel like I'm drinking camomile tea. The distinctive floral taste of lavender coupled with refreshing mint is absolutely glorious. Perfect balance of flavors where the lavender is not too flowery, the mint not too electric… overall a very smoothing experience 😌🧘Camomile Lavender: Unlike the Lavender Mint the Lavender is a bit too overpowering for the camomile. For me, it's a bit too flowery and bitter in a way I can only balance with another less floral tea. Ideally I'd use another camomile but I didn't have any so I used the Nighty Night and while the Lavender is still very strong it's less biting.🫖Cinnamon: I'll be honest, I was NOT looking forward to trying this one. While I love a spicy ginger tea, cinnamon ain my thing 𝓱𝓸𝔀𝓮𝓿𝓮𝓻, I paired it with a generous splash of banana pudding whisky, strawberry gin, a spoonful of jujubes in honey tea and it was absolutely heavenly, buttery even. The cinnamon alone is actually rather pleasant, I was expecting it to be overpowering but it's not at all, more of a twange than in your face. It can actually lean fruity if you want it to, maybe throw in some lemon juice or peach tea. It could also go floral but I went the more cakey route and think this would be great to deepen the flavor profile of a butter beer or hot cocoa. Though it stands it's own it's definitely a more subdued tea than the others.🍋Lemon balm: Though lemon balm is part of the mint family it's definitely more citrusy in flavor than minty. It does however have a slightly minty aftertaste that's closest to spearmint in flavor and is easier to detect if you exhale through your nose between sips. This is the mildest of the tea flavors in this variety pack though it absolutely does have its own charm the slight lemony taste of this tea had me craving more. It tastes very much like lemon zest so while it's distinctly lemony tasting it's not super tangy. I decided to add a bag of lemon ginger tea with a couple splashes of lime to deepen and round out the perfectly cirtusy experience.To sum everything up my favorite was definitely the Lavender Mint with Nighty Night coming in at a very close second. If you're having issues with insomnia these teas unfortunately are not the answer but they are certainly useful in setting the stage for a restful night's sleep which is a fundamental part of good sleep hygiene. I personally have found cbn and indica gummies to be very useful and will mix them in my tea to amplify the calming affect of the tea and the sleepy affect of the gummies in this oddly perfect synergy that has my eyelids drooping before I can even finish the cup.

Now it's not an immediate thing so be patient and use caution and DON'T do what I did.I had me a nice cuppa wen it came and waited several hours (5? 6?) and nothing had happened yet. I thought, maybe I brewed it too weak. So I made a second cup before I laid down to sleep. I slept about 3 hours and woke up to intense pain and the need to GO!I raced to the bathroom and it was not like other over the counter laxatives that makes things watery and loose. Nooo, this was solid and urgent and painful and I felt heat wash over me and like I was going to throw up at the same time. Almost as if I had food poisoning kind of feeling. I remember closing my eyes once I had some relief (after I'd been sweating because of it and not from strain, no no... one does not strain and push too hard or else you have other problems to deal with). The next thing I know I am half-way waking up and not sure where I was or how I got there or what day it was.I had fainted somehow. Passed out cold and fallen off the toilet over beside it wedged between the toilet and the sink cabinet. Even after finally deducing where I was you would think I would try to get up. No. I couldn't. I was utterly without energy and strength and felt drugged. I don't think my eyes even completely opened. I fell back to 'sleep' there for who knows how long since I was at home alone. When I finally could wake and move I had to 'go' again and feared passing out, again. Luckily I didn't. Once business was handled on the toilet I got a shower and laid down for a few more hours and was woken with pains again.No passing out this time and it wasn't as painful but there was still discomfort. Stool was more loose and liquid this time but briefer. And so it's been off and on all night/morning for me.Moral of the story....Drink one or even only half a cup the first time and wait... WAIT!

I go to the Pure Mind blend on days when I have a lot of tasks to do. I can’t say that it helps me focus specifically any better than I would have, but just starting my day drinking this with good intention does 100% help me motivate and stay on task.Some people comment about the powder in the packets that shake loose from the bags. I find this is always the case when I order it by mail… it always comes to me in a paper or plastic mailer that takes a beating in transit. I have never had this problem when I buy it in stores though, so definitely a shipping issue. But I don’t mind the excess powder.Be careful when opening the packets, my boyfriend has a habit of ripping it lower than the tear line sometimes and you will rip the tea bag open this way .Taste 2.5/5Ingredients 5/5I find the flavor bland with a light taste of oregano.

Being that my Wife is from China, I keep many different varieties at my house. This tastes far worse than any Ive had. It also leaves a very powerful aftertaste that doesnt go away easily. No big deal, we arent drinking this for pleasure. I just wanted to set the record straight on the flavor issue. The price is also very outrageous.

At first sip, the blend of sarsaparilla root and other flavors did remind me of the nostalgic beverage, offering a unique twist on my usual tea routine.The flavor profile is interesting, marrying the earthy notes of herbal tea with the distinct, slightly sweet essence of root beer. It's a novel concept that captures the essence of the soda without the fizz, making it a cozy, caffeine-free alternative for evenings.However, the price tag gave me pause. It's on the higher end for tea, which might make one reconsider its value, especially if you're an avid tea drinker looking for a daily staple. While the novelty and taste are commendable, the cost factor could be a deterrent for those on a budget or for whom tea is a frequent indulgence.In conclusion, Nelson's Tea Really Root Beer is a fun, flavorful experiment for those looking to spice up their tea collection.

This is my latest of 4 that I use, and it immediately became my favorite. The scent is rich and reminds me of Tiramisu. As it's cooling, I sit and breathe it in. The taste is the same and sweet enough, but sometimes I add a teaspoon of local honey.It helps me fall asleep easier. I also alternate several different forms of Melatonin (patch, liposomal, compound and sublingual) and some other natural supplements along with the teas. All in all, they're not perfect, but they make my nights restful, even if I don't sleep like a log straight through. I've done all the recommended things for getting restful sleep, including dark room, sleeping away from electrical outlets, early supper, and I don't drink coffee, tea or use refined sugars or gluten. So yes, I'm trying, and this tea makes it all a little easier. I'm at a stage in my life where I have to accept that my nights of falling into bed, going out like a light and sleeping 8 or 9 hours are past. I've read a few books on insomnia, and it helps to know that our ideal sleep schedule is a modern invention. People used to go to bed when the sun went down, sleep for 3 or 4 hours, get up and putter around, maybe even visit neighbors, then go back to bed and sleep till sunrise. It helps is you don't think of periodic wakefulness as a handicap. On the nights when I simply can't lie in bed, I get up, accompanied by my shih tzu, and pile up on the sofa with my iPad or watch TV for a couple of hours, then go back to bed when I'm sleepy.Thank you, Yogi, for your healthy, soothing teas.

I had been doing straight black tea for years, but this is definitely better. I try some days to go back to black tea, and it's nice, but doesn't quite have the pick-me-up that this does. I add a little honey to it for sweetness. Yum! The price is a real drawback, but it's quality tea. If you purchase directly on website instead, you can subscribe and purchase more at a time (e.g. 60 bags every 2 months) and it's cheaper. I definitely use my subscription! Still love it.

I'm not a huge tea fan personally, but after a myriad of pills, supplements, and what felt like everything under the sun to try to fall asleep and stay asleep, I stumbled upon CogniTea. Finally, I was able to get a good nights rest after months!Initially, the scent of the bag itself is nice. It has a good, comforting aroma. However once you let the tea diffuse for around 8 minutes, it's different. The once comforting aroma is pungent and makes you wrinkle your nose. The taste itself is so bad, sour and unappetizing that you'll only be able to take a sip or two at a time, lest you risk an upset stomach. However, please note that I never put anything else in my tea. No sugar, honey, or creamer to help with the taste or smell.Overall, the tea itself helps you fall asleep but it's a doozy to drink, and is nothing short of an unenjoyable nightly battle.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xnaD5oYfL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NNzgNnbyL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZW6IA-EjL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-vlNGQDRL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418KrBCO48L._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418Lc3VgFgL._AC_.jpg | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gJeyvm8SL._AC_.jpg,0.093,0.741,0.166,0.941,positive,positive

My wife and I wanted to try a few tea options to see how they impacted our ability to fall asleep, stay asleep, and feel refreshed the next morning.  CogniTea’s DeepSleep product was one of the products we decided to try and I’m glad we did!I am a fairly heavy sleeper, but consider myself a night owl at times.  I want to go to bed early, but it just doesn’t happen.  I find that once I try to get back on track with an earlier bedtime, I lay there for what seems to be hours trying to fall asleep.  Recognizing these situations beforehand and having CogniTea’s Deep Sleep product has helped me relax, settle my mind, and ultimately get to sleep sooner.  I’m not an every day tea drinker but this product helps me when I need it most.  I especially like that I can leave the product in the mug and not come back to a bitter drink, regardless of how long I let it steep.My wife on the other hand is an extremely light sleeper.  If I so much as move during the night,  I’m waking her up unfortunately.  I convinced her to try Deep Sleep a week ago and she has been sleeping like a log since.  She’s now drinking it every day, has told me she isn’t waking up to use the restroom in the middle of the night, and says her sleep data is drastically improved.

I feel like I sleep a bit more deeply when I drink this, which I have attributed to being more relaxed at bedtime.  It is not a miracle, but I think that the tea itself along with the routine of having it before bed really helps me to relax.Make sure you steep it as directed for 10-15minutes.  I have noticed that if I do not cover my cup to keep the heat in the tea does not come out as strong.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because the flavor is not my favorite.  Its nice for sure, but a bit mild for me.  It is a better and more complex flavor than any other nighttime relaxation tea I have tried.  I prefer to either make a strong cup or sometimes I steep it with a bag of chamomile tea as well which makes a very nice flavor.  I typically have one cup an hour before bed and another while I sit in bed and read right before I go to sleep.

Unfortunately, Amazon does not understand the care required to protect the dried whole flowers during delivery and they put it in a plastic sleeve without even the slightest cushion. The result was a badly crushed product. Rishi packs their direct orders properly so Amazon needs to catch up in this area Most people wouldn't care but if I wanted dust, I would have ordered it. I ordered whole flowers and now I have to put them in paper filters to prevent the crushed bits from ending up in my cup...I don't like the taste of paper, I'm spoiled, I know. I tried my microperforated filter but it wasn't enough. But it doesn't stop me from enjoying this Superior product. I just might order direct next time if Amazon can't correct their poor handling.

But this is even better! Open opening the package, immediately you can smell the freshness of the leaves. As this was my first time using loose leaf tea, it was fun just gently inhaling the scent, taking a moment to identify and appreciate each of the ingredients.Usually I can't wait for the bags to steep but this time I gave the leaves the appropriate amount of time, the recommended 4 minutes, excited to experience each flavor. While my cup usually has a generous helping of sugar and milk, this time I only added a splash to cool it down, and a small teaspoon. It did not disappoint. The flavors came together beautifully, without the usual bitterness that requires all the sugar to make it enjoyable for me. This time, I actually enjoyed the flavor of the tea itself, savoring each sip.Not only was the sup itself wonderful, but the packaging is aesthetically pleasing. Tightly pressed so no air gets inside keeping leaves fresh.The seller also included a complimentary sample of another flavor. I anticipate getting at least 3 or 4 cups from the sample alone!I highly recommend this tea, this seller, and will definitely be purchasing again.Thank you so much!EDIT- Even though the bag doesnt look like much at first, it goes a long way!We've had this bag for 2 weeks now, and had probably 10 cups worth.  We haven't even gone through a quarter of it. We used to have to use two bags of the pre bagged tea for each cup, so even though there were 20 bags, we would only get 10 cups out of it, and it's about $5 at our local store.

My asthma is caused by inflammation to the airways and thyme is touted as possibly being beneficial for inflammation and soothing a throat irritated by coughing. So, hey, anything that might help I'll at least give it a try.  It does have a pleasant herbal taste, at least in my opinion, and is soothing on my throat. Since it is an herbal tea I can drink it anytime of day or even in the evening and not have to worry about caffeine disturbing my sleep. I can usually get two cups of tea from one teabag so for my personal use it lasts me awhile. I purchased this thyme tea online because I could not find it in any of my local stores. I would purchase it again as it would be good for allergy season as well when I get the sneezing and coughing spells from allergen irritants. Plus it just makes a nice warm soothing nightcap too.I have low blood pressure and am not on medication so I don't worry too much about  the thyme tea raising my blood pressure but those on blood pressure medication might want to take caution.

I am not exaggerating one bit.I'm 71 years old with lots of allergies - to foods and environmental vegetation.In July there was a huge wildfire in the mountains near us.  I felt like I was hit with a ton of bricks.  The wildfire smoke wreaked havoc on my body.  My face swelled up badly.  I had difficulty breathing.  My blood pressure went up 21 points and stayed that way for 6 weeks.  I went to my primary care doctor and urgent care during this time.  I was a mess.Then I learned that the fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke settles in the lungs, gets into the bloodstream and can cross the blood-brain barrier.  I was on high doses of prednisone for 6 weeks.  I didn't get better.I finally learned that thyme tea is an anti-inflammatory. So, I bought some from Amazon.  I flavored it with cinnamon, ginger, a pinch of cloves and a little honey.  It tasted good.  After just half a cup, I started to feel better - finally.  After an hour, I was starting to feel 'healthy'.Now, after 3 days, my neighbors and friends are telling me that the swelling on my face is getting better.  When it's so noticeable that even casual neighbors are noticing the difference, you know something good is happening.  And, I just checked my blood pressure.  It's down by 15 points.This tea is really healing me.  And, a friend who is a chef dropped by and I asked him to taste the tea.  After 3 sips, he said that the tightness he had in his chest went away.  I wasn't even aware that he was having chest problems.  He said he hasn't been bothered by asthma in a long time, but that day his chest felt tight.  The tea helped him to feel better.These are true stories.  Take it for what you will.
