We never use toxic pesticides, chemicals, fertilizers or any harmful additives during the growing, harvesting and drying process.  Botanical Name: Eschscholzia californica Common Names: Golden poppy  California Poppy Herb, or Eschscholzia californica, consists of the parts of the plant that grow above the ground, i.e., the leaves, stems and petals. These bulk herbs (which are really leaves and petals) are then dried and can be used as an infusion (as in tea) or an herbal tincture.  A perennial native to the interior valleys of southern Oregon and California and ranging into the deserts of Nevada and Arizona, bulk California Poppy Herb has been used for several thousands of years by the Yokut and Pima Indians for its mildly sedative properties.  While Eschscholzia californica is a close relative of the opium poppy of south central Asia and the Middle East, the alkaloid compounds are far weaker; therefore, it would take an exceptionally large dose to produce any effect beyond mild relaxation. Wholesale California Poppy Herb is most often used in combination with other herbs and plant extracts, usually herbs such as hawthorne, lavender, valerian root and St. John&#39;s Wort.

Girl Gone Herbal&#39;s &quot;Simple Tea&quot; line is designed to be just that: straightforward, single ingredients, recyclable/reusable packaging, and no added anything. Simple as that! :)   Loose-style packaging allows customers to adjust the strength of tea according to their preferences or needs, even if those change by the day.   --Try my new filled teaball option, with 2 heaping teaspoons of herbal tea already packed into the reusable strainer. A perfect, mess-free sampler or gift option--just add a pretty mug (coming soon) or request a colorful, fun, or custom charm!    *Please be aware of potential allergies and use caution when handling herbal products. While valerian is generally safe for most people, please consult a doctor before consuming any new or herbal product, especially if you are pregnant or nursing.   These statements are for informational purposes only and are not intended to diagnose or treat any ailment.   **It&#39;s always best to start with a smaller amount of loose herb, then adjust as needed. If you experience any signs of an allergic reaction, stop drinking immediately and seek medical attention!  ------------------  HOW TO USE:   Loose leaf organic herbal teas, infusions, or decoctions 2oz (1/4 cup) tins are perfect for home-brewed teas! Based on popular folk remedies, these organic herbal tea tins are crafted for the home apothecary.   Use 1-3 teaspoons per 6-8oz cup for tea, 1-2 tablespoons to 1-4 cups of boiling water for infusions, or 3 tablespoons per 1 quart of cold water (then bring to a slow simmer) for decoctions.   Each 2oz (1/4 cup) tin holds approximately 3-4 tablespoons of dried herbs. Makes approximately 10-12, 6oz cups.    ------------------  ABOUT OUR HERBS:   Herbs are homegrown, hand-harvested, home-dried; or occasionally carefully sourced from certified organic manufacturers in the USA. Custom requests welcome!   Consider also or alternatively using valerian in place of oregano or thyme for loose leaf incense (just a pinch will do.

(Yay) ⭐️⭐️⭐️    ☹️👉Due to Etsy Guidelines we are unable to share with you all the incredible benefits this tea may offer you here but please visit us at GetGreenHuman.com for all the juicy &quot;tea&quot; on our blends!    ——————————————————————————  😊 LET’S BE FRIENDS?  We’re a little new to social media but we’ve been told it’s never too late to start. Come join our little party!   •Website: Getgreenhuman.com •Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/getgreenhumans/   •TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@getgreenhuman •Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/getgreenhuman/    —--------------------------------------------------------------------   ✅ All of our teas are ALL CAFFEINE FREE (yay) so feel free to sip away at all hours of the day without having to worry about any eye twitching from too much caffeine   👍 Best of all, you can enjoy our teas hot or iced. (Win-win!)   👉Please note that while this tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, it could be a great addition to a healthy lifestyle.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------  🤔 FAQ’s  For your convenience, we went ahead and came up with a simple Q&A with the most common questions we’ve received from our happy customers:   🍃HOW MUCH TEA IS IN EACH BAG?  Each of our teas come to you in a 2 ounce (57 gram) loose leaf tea bag, which makes about 12-24 cups (depending on how thirsty you are).  It&#39;s a premium product that&#39;s worth every penny. We know you want the best for yourself and your family, and we&#39;re committed to providing high-quality, organic products that you can trust (unlike your ex).     🤷🏻‍♀️ISN’T BREWING THIS TYPE OF TEA AS COMPLICATED AS ASSEMBLING (*insert word that rhymes with WHYKEA) FURNITURE? Not even close! Steeping loose leaf tea is a breeze, and soon you’ll be brewing up a storm like a seasoned tea aficionado.   👉Paul’s Personal Brewing Tip: Our teas are as easy to prep as swiping right - just put 1-2 tsp of tea in a cloth or infuser, pour 2 cups of boiling water, and let steep for 10 minutes.   Drink 1-2 cups daily or as recommended by your healthcare provider. For best results, use it for at least 4-6 weeks (we&#39;re not a one-night stand)  *Bonus Tip: Don&#39;t forget to set the mood - light some candles, put on some smooth jazz, and voila, the perfect cup of organic loose leaf tea is ready for you to sip and savor. Just be sure to sip with your pinky out, because you&#39;re just fancy like that :)     CAN I RE-USE MY TEA LEAVES? Yessss! Reusing tea leaves is like a little act of rebellion - going against the traditional one-and-done tea culture. It&#39;s like recycling, but for tea!  So, can you reuse those precious little tea leaves? You bet your sweet bippy you can! Just steep them again in some hot water, like giving them a second chance at life. Just be sure not to over steep them, because no one likes an overcooked tea leaf.      🥛CAN I ADD MILK? Well, that depends - do you want to risk starting a tea war? Because there are some serious opinions out there about whether or not you should add milk to your tea.  Some of our customers say that adding milk to tea is like adding ketchup to a gourmet meal - it&#39;s just not done.  Others say that adding milk is like putting on a cozy sweater on a chilly day - it just makes everything better.  Loose leaf tea is like a blank canvas - you can add whatever you want to it and make it your own masterpiece.  Just remember that adding milk can change the flavor of the tea, so you might want to experiment a bit to find the perfect balance.       CAN I BREW THIS IN A TEA POT? Oh, absolutely! In fact, brewing loose leaf tea in a tea pot is like throwing a party for your taste buds.  Tea pots allow the tea leaves to expand and fully release their flavors, which means you get a more robust and delicious cup of tea.  Plus, it&#39;s like a fancy little ceremony - you get to pour the hot water over the leaves and watch as they dance and swirl around in the pot.  But here&#39;s the catch - not all tea pots are created equal.  *Pro Tip: You want to make sure you&#39;re using a pot that&#39;s big enough to give the leaves room to breathe, but not so big that they&#39;re swimming around in there like they&#39;re at a pool party.      😱CAN I CHANGE MY SHIPPING ADDRESS AFTER PLACING AN ORDER?!  Trick Question & the answer is, it depends.   The problem with changing orders is that the human on the other end of your phone jumps up and down and does a little happy dance with each new order that comes in.  Then that same human runs to the shipping department and does everything they can to get your order ready and out the door so you can enjoy your tea ASAP.  Which of course might pose an issue if you want to change the address after its already out the door.  Our best advice - reach out to us and if we still have your package with us - of course we will make that fix for you! :)     📦WHAT IS YOUR RETURN POLICY? Due to sanitary reasons, we cannot accept returns but we&#39;re happy to say that we&#39;re not in the business of holding grudges.  If you&#39;re not completely satisfied with your purchase, reach out to us & let us know and we&#39;ll do everything we can to make it right.  Whether you accidentally ordered the wrong tea flavor, spilled some on your favorite shirt, or just changed your mind about the whole loose leaf tea thing, we won&#39;t judge you.  Our return policy is as forgiving as a yoga instructor after a particularly stressful day.  So go ahead and give us a shout if you need to make a return and we will do what we can to help. We&#39;ll still love you and your taste buds no matter what!     😬HELP! MY PACKAGE WAS LOST/ DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING! If your package is lost or damaged during shipping, don&#39;t panic! Just take a deep breath, brew yourself a cup of tea, and let us know.  We will do everything we can to make it right. We&#39;ll work with our carrier partners to track down your package or send a replacement, and we&#39;ll make sure that you get your tea fix one way or another.

The History of Tea According to the legend of how tea was made, the Chinese emperor Shen Nung was sitting under a tree while one of his servants was boiling water. The wind blew and some leaves fell off of the tree and they landed in the boiling water. Having tea being the end creation. In the beginning there is evidence of tea only being used for medicinal purposes. Then around the 3rd century tea become a more prominent daily drink.  The History of Tinctures It&#39;s hard to put an exact date on when tinctures first started being made, but we have rough ideas of where and when they were made. Historians believe that tinctures go as far back as distilled alcohol. There is evidence showing that the Ancient Egyptians-soaked herbs in the alcohol to create their tinctures. We can go based off of the information that is out there that tinctures have been around for a very long time, they were incredibly popular around the Victorian Era.  The History of Oxymels There is evidence that oxymels were first made in ancient Egypt and the word was originally oxalme, the word meant a mixture of salt brine and vinegar. Which was used for a number of different ailments, they would often add honey so as the sour of the vinegar would not be so overpowering. The word oxymel comes from the latin word Oxymeli, which means acid and honey. Being exactly what an oxymel is. There is also evidence that in the ancient Greek times, Hippocrates actually made oxymels for some of his medicinal formulations.",Home & Living < Food & Drink < Coffee & Tea < Tea,CrookedCrowsCO,4.8,3270,,USD,https://schema.org/InStock,California Poppy/Blue Lotus/White Willow Bark,i loved this product thank you so much,5,Crystal Donaldson,2024-09-25

With a history that thrives and stretched across many ancient cultures, Wild Poppy is one of the most abundant flowers in the world. Comforting and heart-centred, Wild Poppy invites a softening and relaxation of the mind, body and emotions. Said to grow at the cave of Hynos, the Greek God of Sleep, Poppy vibrates with themes of sleep and death. Her silky petals offer a velvety red tea to support restful nights.  Like a true loving heart, Wild Poppy is highly connected to vulnerability. She is guided by a force of strength and resilience. Her healing has the potential to support us through difficulties of the heart, offering a nurturing hand to all of love’s greatest fragilities and sacrifice. This tender flower invokes the will and courage to keep your heart open. Poppy helps us to surrender and allows the emotions to be witnessed as a flow, empowering and reawakening our ability to love.  In Greek mythology, Poppy is associated with Demeter, Goddess of Fertility. The gods gave Demeter a Poppy flower to help her sleep after her daughter, Persephone (Goddess of the Underworld) was abducted. Through this story, we can recognise Wild Poppy as the bearer of fierce feminine energy, that revives the passions of the heart and finds resurrection from the deepest of wounds. A true teacher of grief and letting go, this flower leads us through the cycles of death and rebirth.  Priestess of the night, Wild Poppy ensures deeply regenerative nights and is known to be one of the most efficient and powerful plant medicines to soothe insomnia. Gifted with subtle hypnotic properties, Wild Poppy is a gentle and non-addictive relative to the Opium flower. Poppy effectively liberates tensions from the body and brings relaxation, acting as a wonderful pain killer. An infusion of her silky petals can make you feel mellow, dreamy and warm-hearted.  ✥  Precautions: Do not use in combination with other sedatives. Avoid in case of blood disorders.  At high doses, Wild Poppy can induce drowsiness and hallucination.  ☆(❁‿❁)☆  One of our greatest missions, is to exclusively collaborate with people that share a highly sacred approach to Life - we source our products from Organic farming and respectful wild harvest.  *None of these statements have been evaluated by the FDA.
