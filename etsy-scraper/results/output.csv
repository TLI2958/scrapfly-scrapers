Color: Greenish.  Process: dry organic California Poppy herb. Other Names: Golden Poppy. Origin: USA  California Poppy, also known as California Sunlight and Golden Poppy, is the state flower of its namesake and is celebrated with an official state holiday each year on the 6th of April. The dried aerial parts of the plant are used in tea blends and to make tinctures, often in combination with Valerian root, Passionflower herb, Chamomile, Hawthorn leaf and flower, Peppermint, or Catnip in teas to soften its bitter taste.   Native American Indians cooked the California Poppy plant in oil to produce a hair tonic.  Unlike some other members of the poppy family, the California poppy (Eschscholzia California) does not contain the same alkaloids that produce a narcotic effect, such as those found in the opium poppy.

It is harvested by hand. As the title states this is the powder from California Poppy Leaves not the whole plant.  Botanical name: Eschscholzia Californica  Also called: California Sunlight, Cup of Gold and Golden poppy  California Poppy is a very stemy plant and is only produced as herb (the entire plant cut up). Surfside Naturals Pure Leaf™ California Poppy is hand processed to remove a significant percentage of the large, hard stems. On average, when one pound (16 ounces) of this herb is processed, nine ounces of stems are removed, leaving 7 ounces of leaf, flower, and some smaller, more supple stems. This enhances the potency and flavor of the material.  California Poppy is said to possibly have a history of being used in a diffusion for relaxation and may have mild pain-relieving properties. More scientific research is needed to fully verify its effectiveness.  This item is considered perishable. We are unable to accept returns unless the wrong item is shipped or the item is damaged.

We never use toxic pesticides, chemicals, fertilizers or any harmful additives during the growing, harvesting and drying process.  Botanical Name: Eschscholzia californica Common Names: Golden poppy  California Poppy Herb, or Eschscholzia californica, consists of the parts of the plant that grow above the ground, i.e., the leaves, stems and petals. These bulk herbs (which are really leaves and petals) are then dried and can be used as an infusion (as in tea) or an herbal tincture.  A perennial native to the interior valleys of southern Oregon and California and ranging into the deserts of Nevada and Arizona, bulk California Poppy Herb has been used for several thousands of years by the Yokut and Pima Indians for its mildly sedative properties.  While Eschscholzia californica is a close relative of the opium poppy of south central Asia and the Middle East, the alkaloid compounds are far weaker; therefore, it would take an exceptionally large dose to produce any effect beyond mild relaxation. Wholesale California Poppy Herb is most often used in combination with other herbs and plant extracts, usually herbs such as hawthorne, lavender, valerian root and St. John&#39;s Wort.  Eschscholzia californica is commonly combined with magnesium salts and all natural bulk herbs such as hawthorne. Eschscholzia californica is among those natural herbs that should be avoided by pregnant and nursing women. Even all natural herbs should not be given to young children except under the advice and guidance of a qualified herbalist or naturopathic doctor.  Warning: Not to be used during pregnancy.
