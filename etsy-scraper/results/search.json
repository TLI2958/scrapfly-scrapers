Do not drink with any dairy products 30 minutes before and after consumption.  Tinctures can also be administered directly into the mouth without the \nassistance of water however some tinctures are unpalatable which is why most people prefer to dilute them into a beverage.\n\nSafety information: Keep out of reach of children.
