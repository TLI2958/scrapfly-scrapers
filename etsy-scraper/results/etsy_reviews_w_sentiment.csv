Color: Green.  Process: Dry Catnip herb leaf. Other Names: Catmint.  Also called Catmint, Catnip is a botanical cousin to peppermint and spearmint. It has a slightly sweet, minty profile, adding a nice indulgence in teas, fruit salads, and Mediterranean dishes.  Dried Catnip is a natural deterrent to mice, mosquitoes, termites, cockroaches, and many other pests who strongly dislike the plant.  A terpene compound in the plant called nepetalactone is also highly attractive to most house cats. Molecules of this chemical bind the receptors in the lining of the vomeronasal organ when the cat sniffs the plant, triggering the typical “crazy cat” behavior most feline enthusiasts are familiar with.

It is harvested by hand. As the title states this is the powder from California Poppy Leaves not the whole plant.  Botanical name: Eschscholzia Californica  Also called: California Sunlight, Cup of Gold and Golden poppy  California Poppy is a very stemy plant and is only produced as herb (the entire plant cut up). Surfside Naturals Pure Leaf™ California Poppy is hand processed to remove a significant percentage of the large, hard stems. On average, when one pound (16 ounces) of this herb is processed, nine ounces of stems are removed, leaving 7 ounces of leaf, flower, and some smaller, more supple stems. This enhances the potency and flavor of the material.  California Poppy is said to possibly have a history of being used in a diffusion for relaxation and may have mild pain-relieving properties. More scientific research is needed to fully verify its effectiveness.  This item is considered perishable. We are unable to accept returns unless the wrong item is shipped or the item is damaged.  Cautions: may cause drowsiness and complications with anesthesia.  Pregnant or nursing women and persons with health problems must consult a physician before use.

With a history that thrives and stretched across many ancient cultures, Wild Poppy is one of the most abundant flowers in the world. Comforting and heart-centred, Wild Poppy invites a softening and relaxation of the mind, body and emotions. Said to grow at the cave of Hynos, the Greek God of Sleep, Poppy vibrates with themes of sleep and death. Her silky petals offer a velvety red tea to support restful nights.  Like a true loving heart, Wild Poppy is highly connected to vulnerability. She is guided by a force of strength and resilience. Her healing has the potential to support us through difficulties of the heart, offering a nurturing hand to all of love’s greatest fragilities and sacrifice. This tender flower invokes the will and courage to keep your heart open. Poppy helps us to surrender and allows the emotions to be witnessed as a flow, empowering and reawakening our ability to love.  In Greek mythology, Poppy is associated with Demeter, Goddess of Fertility. The gods gave Demeter a Poppy flower to help her sleep after her daughter, Persephone (Goddess of the Underworld) was abducted. Through this story, we can recognise Wild Poppy as the bearer of fierce feminine energy, that revives the passions of the heart and finds resurrection from the deepest of wounds. A true teacher of grief and letting go, this flower leads us through the cycles of death and rebirth.  Priestess of the night, Wild Poppy ensures deeply regenerative nights and is known to be one of the most efficient and powerful plant medicines to soothe insomnia. Gifted with subtle hypnotic properties, Wild Poppy is a gentle and non-addictive relative to the Opium flower.
