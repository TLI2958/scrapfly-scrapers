With a history that thrives and stretched across many ancient cultures, Wild Poppy is one of the most abundant flowers in the world. Comforting and heart-centred, Wild Poppy invites a softening and relaxation of the mind, body and emotions. Said to grow at the cave of Hynos, the Greek God of Sleep, Poppy vibrates with themes of sleep and death. Her silky petals offer a velvety red tea to support restful nights.  Like a true loving heart, Wild Poppy is highly connected to vulnerability. She is guided by a force of strength and resilience. Her healing has the potential to support us through difficulties of the heart, offering a nurturing hand to all of love’s greatest fragilities and sacrifice. This tender flower invokes the will and courage to keep your heart open. Poppy helps us to surrender and allows the emotions to be witnessed as a flow, empowering and reawakening our ability to love.  In Greek mythology, Poppy is associated with Demeter, Goddess of Fertility. The gods gave Demeter a Poppy flower to help her sleep after her daughter, Persephone (Goddess of the Underworld) was abducted. Through this story, we can recognise Wild Poppy as the bearer of fierce feminine energy, that revives the passions of the heart and finds resurrection from the deepest of wounds. A true teacher of grief and letting go, this flower leads us through the cycles of death and rebirth.  Priestess of the night, Wild Poppy ensures deeply regenerative nights and is known to be one of the most efficient and powerful plant medicines to soothe insomnia. Gifted with subtle hypnotic properties, Wild Poppy is a gentle and non-addictive relative to the Opium flower.
