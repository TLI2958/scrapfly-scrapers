Turn jar over gently. Overturning the jar rapidly will cause shifting in the sprouting seeds. This can break the tender shoots and kill the spout. This breakage causes the sprout to spoil. Sprouts should be ready to eat in 3-5 days, depending on the seed used. Put in sunlight during the last day to add chlorophyll."

There are many types of collagen that differ by how the molecules are assembled and where the collagen is used in your body. Our \n powder contains both type I and type III collagen, which are 2 of the 5 main types of collagen:\n: This type of collagen makes up 80 to 90% of your body\u2019s total collagen. Because it is densely packed, type I collagen provides structure to skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\n: Found in elastic cartilage, such as knees and shoulders, this type of collagen provides support for joints.\n: This type of collagen is commonly present with Type I and is found in muscles, arteries, and organs.\u00a0\n: Found in the layers of your skin, type IV collagen helps support various functions of the skin.\n: This type of collagen is found in the cornea of your eyes, bones, some layers of skin, hair, and tissue of the placenta.\nOur advanced collagen formula also includes two additional powerhouse ingredients \u2013 hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. Hyaluronic acid is a component of connective tissue and can provide the fluid matrix for joint lubrication, skin hydration, and repair.* Vitamin C plays a role in the production of collagen and assists in antioxidant protection.* Research suggests that regular consumption of these nutrients can provide the body with the fundamental building blocks that can help to support the health of joints, bones, skin, hair, and nails.*\n \n features non-bovine, marine-sourced collagen peptides with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. The specially processed fish collagen is enzymatically hydrolyzed (broken down) into low molecular weight component amino acid peptides in order to help ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability.*\n^May vary slightly from batch to batch\n*Essential Amino Acids\nOur products undergo quality testing where they are evaluated by an independent ISO-certified lab using scientifically-validated test methods to ensure authenticity, purity, and potency of ingredients.
