There are many types of collagen that differ by how the molecules are assembled and where the collagen is used in your body. Our \n powder contains both type I and type III collagen, which are 2 of the 5 main types of collagen:\n: This type of collagen makes up 80 to 90% of your body\u2019s total collagen. Because it is densely packed, type I collagen provides structure to skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\n: Found in elastic cartilage, such as knees and shoulders, this type of collagen provides support for joints.\n: This type of collagen is commonly present with Type I and is found in muscles, arteries, and organs.\u00a0\n: Found in the layers of your skin, type IV collagen helps support various functions of the skin.\n: This type of collagen is found in the cornea of your eyes, bones, some layers of skin, hair, and tissue of the placenta.\nOur advanced collagen formula also includes two additional powerhouse ingredients \u2013 hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. Hyaluronic acid is a component of connective tissue and can provide the fluid matrix for joint lubrication, skin hydration, and repair.* Vitamin C plays a role in the production of collagen and assists in antioxidant protection.* Research suggests that regular consumption of these nutrients can provide the body with the fundamental building blocks that can help to support the health of joints, bones, skin, hair, and nails.*\n \n features non-bovine, marine-sourced collagen peptides with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. The specially processed fish collagen is enzymatically hydrolyzed (broken down) into low molecular weight component amino acid peptides in order to help ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability.*\n^May vary slightly from batch to batch\n*Essential Amino Acids\nOur products undergo quality testing where they are evaluated by an independent ISO-certified lab using scientifically-validated test methods to ensure authenticity, purity, and potency of ingredients. For added transparency, we make the results available to you in our iTested Verified Reports so you can see for yourself.",

For most people taste is simply a matter of flavor. We believe that the taste of goodness is about making conscious and thoughtful decisions about the foods we eat, the planet we share and the people we work with every day.\nFlaxseed offers the benefits of fiber, Omega-3 fatty acid Alpha-Linolenic Acid ALA, protein and SDG lignans. Fiber promotes regularity, supports normal functioning of the digestive tract and lipids within normal levels. ALA is an Omega-3 essential fatty acid that helps support normal cardiovascular function and helps to maintain healthy hair, skin and nails.\u00a0\nSpectrum Essentials\u00ae Brand Flaxseeds are premium quality organic seeds that have been carefully selected for their nutritive content. Flaxseed is a highly concentrated source of SDG lignans\u2014 the amount of SDG lignans can vary depending on seasonal variation in growing conditions. These select seeds are meticulously cleaned using a three-part process to remove low weight, broken and dirty seeds commonly found in bulk bins.\u00a0\nOnly Spectrum Essentials\u00ae brand uses a proprietary milling process that finely slices the seed, rather than crushing it, thereby preventing the loss of valuable nutrients from oxidation. The sliced seed is immediately packaged in this light protective pouch and airtight sealed to ensure optimum nutritive benefits and product freshness.\u00a0",

In their original state, these wholesome foods provide a magnificent combination of nutrients that are essential to health. We honor this innate perfection by keeping our foods simple, and our chis seeds are an excellent example of that practice. They are simply seeds from the chia plant - nothing added or removed. They're great in puddings and smoothies, sprinkled on top of porridge and salads, and added to baked goods in place of flaxseed meal or poppy seeds. What more, Bob's Red Mill Chia Seeds contain 4280 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids.\nTake a look at the ingredients-or rather, the ingredient. That's right. There's only one: chia seeds.

K2 helps trigger bone cells to extract calcium from the blood and bind it to bones. Low levels of vitamin K2 can cause weakened bones and increase calcification of arteries and other soft tissues. \u00a0Vitamin K2 is the ideal companion nutrient to Vitamin D3 because Vitamin D helps extract calcium from the diet/supplements and K2 helps bind that calcium to the bone matrix to develop strong bones.",
