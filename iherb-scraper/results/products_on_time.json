Discover why Teeccino fans describe it as smoother, richer, and creamier than coffee. The secret? French chicory, the roasted root often added to coffee, blended with barley, Italy's favorite caffeine-free roasted brew, and Spanish carob, famed for its chocolaty flavor. Enriched with maca, the Peruvian energizing herb, a cup of Teeccino brims with many health benefits:\nMost of Teeccino's ingredients are grown in Europe and the USA. We pioneer new trade for organic chicory with smallholder farmers in India and for wild harvested ram\u00f3n seeds with rainforest villagers in Central America. These ingredients create economic opportunities where income is scarce. By drinking Teeccino, you join us in supporting families devoted to organic, fair trade values in both developed and emerging countries.",

Orange Oil refreshes with its ability to invigorate the senses while gently cleansing the skin.\nNubian Heritage is the brainchild of two New York street vendors. In 1992, fresh out of college and without jobs, Rich and Nyema embarked on a mission to produce  luxurious natural products from traditional African recipes with fair trade ingredients. Today Nubian Heritage offers culturally authentic natural products inspired by global ancient healing philosophies. Although Nubian Heritage  products are no longer made in bath tubs, little else has changed; the company still makes its own product, still uses fair trade ingredient and still invests in community commerce.\nLemongrass, native to Southeast Asia, has been used in purification rituals for generations and revered  for its invigorating aroma. Steam-distilled Madagascan  Lemongrass has a strong history of use in Cuban, Indian and Brazilian folk medicine. Indigenous Australians have used the oil extracted from the Tea Tree's needles for its remarkable properties.",

    "1) Place two tablespoons of sprouting seeds or 1/2 cup of legumes/grains in a sprouting jar with three times as much water as seeds. Soak overnight. For many small seeds, five hours of soaking is sufficient.",
    "2) Drain the water from the jar. Rinse seeds in fresh, lukewarm water and drain again. For well drained seeds/spouts, lay jar at an angle in a warm (70\u00baF), dark place.",
    "3) Rinse and drain seeds twice a day. In hot and dry weather, you may need to rinse the seeds three times a day. In very humid weather, the seeds should be kept in a dry place. Turn jar over gently. Overturning the jar rapidly will cause shifting in the sprouting seeds. This can break the tender shoots and kill the spout. This breakage causes the sprout to spoil. Sprouts should be ready to eat in 3-5 days, depending on the seed used. Put in sunlight during the last day to add chlorophyll."

Enriched with California's almonds, dates, and figs, Teeccino makes a delicious cup of tea... or is it coffee?

Hyaluronic acid is a component of connective tissue and can provide the fluid matrix for joint lubrication, skin hydration, and repair.* Vitamin C plays a role in the production of collagen and assists in antioxidant protection.* Research suggests that regular consumption of these nutrients can provide the body with the fundamental building blocks that can help to support the health of joints, bones, skin, hair, and nails.*\n \n features non-bovine, marine-sourced collagen peptides with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. The specially processed fish collagen is enzymatically hydrolyzed (broken down) into low molecular weight component amino acid peptides in order to help ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability.*\n^May vary slightly from batch to batch\n*Essential Amino Acids\nOur products undergo quality testing where they are evaluated by an independent ISO-certified lab using scientifically-validated test methods to ensure authenticity, purity, and potency of ingredients.

There are many types of collagen that differ by how the molecules are assembled and where the collagen is used in your body. Our \n powder contains both type I and type III collagen, which are 2 of the 5 main types of collagen:\n: This type of collagen makes up 80 to 90% of your body\u2019s total collagen. Because it is densely packed, type I collagen provides structure to skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\n: Found in elastic cartilage, such as knees and shoulders, this type of collagen provides support for joints.\n: This type of collagen is commonly present with Type I and is found in muscles, arteries, and organs.\u00a0\n: Found in the layers of your skin, type IV collagen helps support various functions of the skin.\n: This type of collagen is found in the cornea of your eyes, bones, some layers of skin, hair, and tissue of the placenta.\nOur advanced collagen formula also includes two additional powerhouse ingredients \u2013 hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. Hyaluronic acid is a component of connective tissue and can provide the fluid matrix for joint lubrication, skin hydration, and repair.* Vitamin C plays a role in the production of collagen and assists in antioxidant protection.* Research suggests that regular consumption of these nutrients can provide the body with the fundamental building blocks that can help to support the health of joints, bones, skin, hair, and nails.*\n \n features non-bovine, marine-sourced collagen peptides with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. The specially processed fish collagen is enzymatically hydrolyzed (broken down) into low molecular weight component amino acid peptides in order to help ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability.*\n^May vary slightly from batch to batch\n*Essential Amino Acids\nOur products undergo quality testing where they are evaluated by an independent ISO-certified lab using scientifically-validated test methods to ensure authenticity, purity, and potency of ingredients.

There are many types of collagen that differ by how the molecules are assembled and where the collagen is used in your body. Our \n powder contains both type I and type III collagen, which are 2 of the 5 main types of collagen:\n: This type of collagen makes up 80 to 90% of your body\u2019s total collagen. Because it is densely packed, type I collagen provides structure to skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\n: Found in elastic cartilage, such as knees and shoulders, this type of collagen provides support for joints.\n: This type of collagen is commonly present with Type I and is found in muscles, arteries, and organs.\u00a0\n: Found in the layers of your skin, type IV collagen helps support various functions of the skin.\n: This type of collagen is found in the cornea of your eyes, bones, some layers of skin, hair, and tissue of the placenta.\nOur advanced collagen formula also includes two additional powerhouse ingredients \u2013 hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. Hyaluronic acid is a component of connective tissue and can provide the fluid matrix for joint lubrication, skin hydration, and repair.* Vitamin C plays a role in the production of collagen and assists in antioxidant protection.* Research suggests that regular consumption of these nutrients can provide the body with the fundamental building blocks that can help to support the health of joints, bones, skin, hair, and nails.*\n \n features non-bovine, marine-sourced collagen peptides with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. The specially processed fish collagen is enzymatically hydrolyzed (broken down) into low molecular weight component amino acid peptides in order to help ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability.*\n^May vary slightly from batch to batch\n*Essential Amino Acids\nOur products undergo quality testing where they are evaluated by an independent ISO-certified lab using scientifically-validated test methods to ensure authenticity, purity, and potency of ingredients. For added transparency, we make the results available to you in our iTested Verified Reports so you can see for yourself.",

There are many types of collagen that differ by how the molecules are assembled and where the collagen is used in your body. Our \n powder contains both type I and type III collagen, which are 2 of the 5 main types of collagen:\n: This type of collagen makes up 80 to 90% of your body\u2019s total collagen. Because it is densely packed, type I collagen provides structure to skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\n: Found in elastic cartilage, such as knees and shoulders, this type of collagen provides support for joints.\n: This type of collagen is commonly present with Type I and is found in muscles, arteries, and organs.\u00a0\n: Found in the layers of your skin, type IV collagen helps support various functions of the skin.\n: This type of collagen is found in the cornea of your eyes, bones, some layers of skin, hair, and tissue of the placenta.\nOur advanced collagen formula also includes two additional powerhouse ingredients \u2013 hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. Hyaluronic acid is a component of connective tissue and can provide the fluid matrix for joint lubrication, skin hydration, and repair.* Vitamin C plays a role in the production of collagen and assists in antioxidant protection.* Research suggests that regular consumption of these nutrients can provide the body with the fundamental building blocks that can help to support the health of joints, bones, skin, hair, and nails.*\n \n features non-bovine, marine-sourced collagen peptides with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. The specially processed fish collagen is enzymatically hydrolyzed (broken down) into low molecular weight component amino acid peptides in order to help ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability.*\n^May vary slightly from batch to batch\n*Essential Amino Acids\nOur products undergo quality testing where they are evaluated by an independent ISO-certified lab using scientifically-validated test methods to ensure authenticity, purity, and potency of ingredients. For added transparency, we make the results available to you in our iTested Verified Reports so you can see for yourself.",

In their original state, these wholesome foods provide a magnificent combination of nutrients that are essential to health. We honor this innate perfection by keeping our foods simple, and our chis seeds are an excellent example of that practice. They are simply seeds from the chia plant - nothing added or removed. They're great in puddings and smoothies, sprinkled on top of porridge and salads, and added to baked goods in place of flaxseed meal or poppy seeds. What more, Bob's Red Mill Chia Seeds contain 4280 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids.\nTake a look at the ingredients-or rather, the ingredient. That's right. There's only one: chia seeds. It doesn't get much simpler than that. And we think that's just how it should be.\u00a0\n-To your good health, Bob Moore",

In their original state, these wholesome foods provide a magnificent combination of nutrients that are essential to health. We honor this innate perfection by keeping our foods simple, and our chis seeds are an excellent example of that practice. They are simply seeds from the chia plant - nothing added or removed. They're great in puddings and smoothies, sprinkled on top of porridge and salads, and added to baked goods in place of flaxseed meal or poppy seeds. What more, Bob's Red Mill Chia Seeds contain 4280 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids.\nTake a look at the ingredients-or rather, the ingredient. That's right. There's only one: chia seeds. It doesn't get much simpler than that. And we think that's just how it should be.\u00a0\n-To your good health, Bob Moore",

    "3) Rinse and drain seeds twice a day. In hot and dry weather, you may need to rinse the seeds three times a day. In very humid weather, the seeds should be kept in a dry place. Turn jar over gently. Overturning the jar rapidly will cause shifting in the sprouting seeds. This can break the tender shoots and kill the spout. This breakage causes the sprout to spoil. Sprouts should be ready to eat in 3-5 days, depending on the seed used. Put in sunlight during the last day to add chlorophyll."

Hyaluronic acid is a component of connective tissue and can provide the fluid matrix for joint lubrication, skin hydration, and repair.* Vitamin C plays a role in the production of collagen and assists in antioxidant protection.* Research suggests that regular consumption of these nutrients can provide the body with the fundamental building blocks that can help to support the health of joints, bones, skin, hair, and nails.*\n \n features non-bovine, marine-sourced collagen peptides with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C. The specially processed fish collagen is enzymatically hydrolyzed (broken down) into low molecular weight component amino acid peptides in order to help ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability.*\n^May vary slightly from batch to batch\n*Essential Amino Acids\nOur products undergo quality testing where they are evaluated by an independent ISO-certified lab using scientifically-validated test methods to ensure authenticity, purity, and potency of ingredients.
