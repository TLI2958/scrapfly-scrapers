It is an excellent option for a medium-heat cooking oil, ideal for use when baking or sauteing. You can also easily add it to numerous recipes as a replacement for butter or olive oil. It even makes an excellent addition to smoothies, shakes, and dressings by adding a light, tropical flavor. Externally, it can be used on the hair and skin to moisturize, tame frizz, and add a protective barrier.\n \n is sourced from the Philippines. It is made by cold pressing the liquid from coconut meat and then separating the oil without the use of bleach to produce a smooth, unrefined virgin oil.
