In their original state, these wholesome foods provide a magnificent combination of nutrients that are essential to health. We honor this innate perfection by keeping our foods simple, and our chis seeds are an excellent example of that practice. They are simply seeds from the chia plant - nothing added or removed. They're great in puddings and smoothies, sprinkled on top of porridge and salads, and added to baked goods in place of flaxseed meal or poppy seeds. What more, Bob's Red Mill Chia Seeds contain 4280 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids.\nTake a look at the ingredients-or rather, the ingredient. That's right. There's only one: chia seeds.

This perspective shaped my childhood and evolved into a quest for knowledge of ethnobotany (study of the relationships between peoples and plants). I'm humbled that this exploration allowed me to build a line of natural health products.\nAt MRM, we are inspired by nature and utilize science as a tool to learn, incorporate, support and educate what the natural world has to offer.\nRespectfully, these Superfoods are the foods our ancestors thrived on, not today's foods we survive on.\nMany Thanks, Mark Olson Founder of MRM",

It\u2019s Vegan!\u00a0\nMRM Vegan Vitamin D3 is a cholecalciferol form of Vitamin D3 that is extracted exclusively from lichens, an algae/fungi commensal organism, to meet calcium and bone health needs of both vegans and vegetarians.\nVitamin K2 is required for the synthesis of certain proteins (like ones involved in calcium binding) in the body. K2 helps trigger bone cells to extract calcium from the blood and bind it to bones. Low levels of vitamin K2 can cause weakened bones and increase calcification of arteries and other soft tissues. \u00a0Vitamin K2 is the ideal companion nutrient to Vitamin D3 because Vitamin D helps extract calcium from the diet/supplements and K2 helps bind that calcium to the bone matrix to develop strong bones.",

Orange Oil refreshes with its ability to invigorate the senses while gently cleansing the skin.\nNubian Heritage is the brainchild of two New York street vendors. In 1992, fresh out of college and without jobs, Rich and Nyema embarked on a mission to produce  luxurious natural products from traditional African recipes with fair trade ingredients. Today Nubian Heritage offers culturally authentic natural products inspired by global ancient healing philosophies. Although Nubian Heritage  products are no longer made in bath tubs, little else has changed; the company still makes its own product, still uses fair trade ingredient and still invests in community commerce.\nLemongrass, native to Southeast Asia, has been used in purification rituals for generations and revered  for its invigorating aroma. Steam-distilled Madagascan  Lemongrass has a strong history of use in Cuban, Indian and Brazilian folk medicine.
