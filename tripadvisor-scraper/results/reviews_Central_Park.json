      "text": "Central Park in New York City is truly a gem and a must-visit for anyone exploring the city. Spanning 843 acres, it offers a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. The park is perfect for leisurely strolls, with its winding paths, expansive lawns, and beautifully landscaped gardens. There are countless picturesque spots, from the iconic Bow Bridge to the tranquil Bethesda Terrace. One of the park’s highlights is the variety of activities available. You can rent a bike, paddle a boat on the lake, or simply relax with a picnic on the Great Lawn. The Central Park Zoo is a fun stop, especially for families, and there are several playgrounds scattered throughout. The park is also home to some lovely fountains, statues, and art installations that make each visit unique. During my visit, I enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere, even though it was a busy weekend. The contrast between the city's skyscrapers and the park's natural beauty is something you can’t experience anywhere else. Whether you're visiting for a quick escape or spending a whole day, Central Park offers something for everyone. It’s a perfect blend of nature and city life. Highly recommended!"

We walked from Columbus Circle to Bethesda Terrace before we needed to turn around and head back. We were moving slower than usual as it was around 34 degrees Celsius and very humid that day. I would have liked to see Belvedere Castle and Strawberry Fields, so make sure you look at a map of Central Park and plan your exploration."

Sirens, car horns, and overwhelming city noise. Once you get 100 feet into the park the city goes away. You can actually hear birds chirping, wind through trees, and silence. The city disappears. My favorite by far was Belvedere Castle. Also loved Bethesda Fountain, The Mall, and Turtle Pond. When visiting New York City this park is a must. Highly recommended!"

Just be careful of the bikes which try to take you around the park Some of them are not licensed and insured and will try and rob you. If you want to be taken around the park on one of the bikes and given a tour, make sure that they have an ID tag and you can always get the price down if you haggle. The Zoo is not the biggest but it’s in a city. Overall it’s a great place to visit."

I think it would take days upon days to see all Central Park has to offer."

If the rest of Manhattan represents all the responsibilities of life, entering Central Park represents setting aside all that dull care for a looping stroll redolent of childhood. It never occurred to me to review a park before, yet here I am. It's a convenient and splendid escape from work and life when you need it. To borrow from Thoreau: \"Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.\""

Lots of cycle lanes, runners, people enjoying the sunshine on the grass, plenty of benches, ponds for the ducks to swim, and even a castle inside it. There are lots of trees for shade, and even on busy days you don’t feel overcrowded due to the sheer size of the Park."

I’ve seen so many movies and series that take place in NYC, but I never thought it would be THAT PRETTY! Must be angles and all that, right!? WRONG. This park is spotless. So clean, so beautiful, so peaceful. 10/10. No, 100/10. If you love nature, walks and beautiful sights, come to Central Park. It doesn’t even feel like a park in a city. In certain areas it literally feels like you’re hiking. It is big enough to not feel uncomfortably crowded, there are squirrels and raccoons and other cute animals just hanging around, and even in gloomy weather, it’s still stunning!"

It’s hard to really understand the scale of the park until you’re there so to make the most of our day we hired bikes which made for a brilliant day out and great way of seeing everything. It’s a pretty flat park so the cycling was easy and pretty well laid out with specific cycle lanes and really friendly volunteers giving directions and very politely letting you knowing you’re cycling in the wrong areas. So many iconic views and places in the park and really great audio descriptions that you can access on your phone about the history of the park and specific areas. We also visited the Met and The Guggenheim whilst we were there so you could spend a whole day there and still need to return to see more. Of course the classics such as the Zoo, the Boat House, the carousel, the turtles all need to be visited but it’s also a lovely green space with amazing views of Manhattan and a perfect place to chill out and watch the world go by."

It was great to see native New Yorkers relaxing in their natural environment. My kids liked to climb rocks and pet dogs with owners permission. We could have rented a rowboat for $25 per hour I think . We fed soft pretzel crumbs to the turtles at a lake and walked around the lake. This was not the Onassis reservoir, but a smaller lake. We rode back to port authority from the 72 street station by the Dakota where John Lennon lived."

Every bridge, every small body of water, every tree lined area and every meadow was lovely. We walked across it after dark and stayed to well lit paths and didn’t feel unsafe and got to see fireflies! So many cute dogs going for walks. We also saw several rats."

People cycling, walking, blading,  altogether quite lovely.  Amongst the most famous landmarks were, Strawberry Fields, John Lennon's home, Yoko still lives there and The Alice in Wonderland statue along with the famous fountain featured in Friends.

We found a spot and were happy to see so many families and couples lying around and having a relaxing time. We did the same. We also tasted the corndogs and some other snacks. Best corndog I have ever had! The experience led us to also try the horse-drawn carriages, which was also enjoyable. We all know horses have a certain scent, so be prepared for that.  All-in-all a relaxing experience and definitely enjoyable for anyone."

We explored this iconic park through a guided bike tour and leisurely walks, soaking in its natural beauty and historical landmarks. The guided bike tour was informative and enjoyable, providing insights into the park's rich history and hidden gems. We pedaled through winding paths, past lush greenery, and iconic sights like Bethesda Terrace and Strawberry Fields. Walking through the park allowed us to appreciate its vastness and diverse landscapes—from scenic lakes to charming bridges and vibrant gardens. Central Park is not just a park; it's a sanctuary amidst the bustling city, offering endless opportunities for recreation and relaxation. Whether you're a local or a visitor, exploring Central Park is a must-do experience that captures the essence of New York City's vibrant spirit. We can't wait to return and discover more of its beauty!"

We had a list of \"must sees\" and found it helpful to guide us in the direction we wanted to go when we would approach a sign with choices.  Lots of fountains, statues, ponds, flowers and turtles!  An enjoyable, but very hot and humid afternoon.  Crowds were not as bad as I had expected for a Saturday.  We were there from 12:00-3:00."

      "text": "Did you know that more gunpowder was used to clear the area of soil and rocks for Central Park in New York City than was used at the battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War? Yet Central Park is only the fifth largest park in New York City. But it is the most visited urban park in the United States with an estimated 42 million visitors annually. Located between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side neighborhoods of Manhattan, Central Park is bordered by Central Park North at 110th Street, Central Park South at 59th Street, Central Park West at 8th Avenue and Fifth Avenue on the east, Harlem to the north and Midtown Manhattan to the south. Designed by architects  Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the 843-acre property was opened to the public in 1858. The first landscaped park in the United States, it is worth $528 billion by today's value scale. It contains five visitors centers, 21 children's playgrounds, eight lakes and ponds, all created artificially, more than 20,000 trees, is patrolled by its own New York City Police Department precinct, is surrounded b a 29,025-foot-long and three feet, 10 inches high stone wall, 29 sculptures, 26 baseball fields, 12 tennis courts, eight basketball courts, two ice skating rinks, seven soccer fields, four volleyball courts and two indoor restaurants. Wildlife that inhabit the park includes fish, turtles, frogs, bats, squirrels, chipmunks, opossum and birds. No snakes. Open from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily, The park also features four drives, 6.1 miles long, that are used by runners, joggers, pedestrians, bicyclists, inline skaters and scooters. And there are three scenic drives that highlight New York City's skyline. Main attractions are Ramble and Lake, the Central Park zoo, Hallett Nature Sanctuary, Wollman Rink, Central Park Carousel, Sheep Meadow, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and Delacoste Theater. It is one of the most filmed locations in the world and has been the site of several major events, including the Simon and Garfunkel concert in 1981 and the Garth Brooks concert in 1997. Two interesting attractions are Cleopatra's Needle, a red granite obelisk and the oldest man-made structure in Central Park that originally was erected in ancient Egypt in 1,450 BC; and Strawberry Fields, a 2.5-acre landscaped section which commemorates the life of John Lennon, who was murdered outside the nearby Dakota apartment building in 1980. Central Park was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1963, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and designated a New York City scenic landmark in 1974."

An oasis of peace and recreation - a fun, safe and clean environment to spend a relaxing day away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. As I was leisurely walking through the park I detected a gaggle of manlets dressed up as garden gnomes attempting to steal women's high heels! The stunted manlets were quickly scared off when one of the women's pet chihuahua detected them and confronted the perfidious manlets while barking loudly. Hilarity ensued as the gnomish manlets fled in terror! The approaching chihuahua must have been like a charging grizzly bear to the petite and insignificant manlet boys. Manlets BTFO."

They were crawling all over the rocks and ground! They were also building an ice rink which looked really cool! There were LOTS of fruit salad stores and quite a few drinks, food and ice cream stores. It wasn’t very busy as the roads around the park were huge, with traffic lights to help make sure nothing bad happened!

Less crowded than the Reservoir and Sheep Meadow, these are quieter spots, perfect for picnic and contemplation.  Recommend daylight visits.  Nice refuge from the bustle of the city, but still open to Tour de France cyclist wannabees' hysteria.  Always look out for the rushed bike riders.  Without human rooted hysteria, this could be heavenly."

Sadly the weather wasn’t so great the morning we were here and it poured in the afternoon, making our visit shorter than we wanted, but we still got to explore the North End throughly, just had to catch a subway home after Belvedere Castle. One of my favorite ways to see the park is to take the subway to 110th, and then walk ALL the way to the south end, just meandering through the park. You stumble upon a lot this way. It’s a lot of walking but worth it if you have the time to wander!"

There is so much to see and experience, and I could have easily spent a full day wandering through the park’s many nooks and crannies. If you're in New York City, Central Park is a must-visit."

I found one by asking a person by the north entrance to the zoo. There’s a white building across the path with double doors a couple steps below the path. The door is locked but at least on Sundays has a security guard behind the door. He will open the door for you and allow you to use the bathroom there.  That’s my contribution."

Some wonderful relaxing places as well as busier areas such as the fountain and boating lake. Range of food options and it was great to watch some baseball being played while at one cafe. Nice and cool on an August sunny day under the trees. Simple to get to on the metro. We went and watch a quartet play at sunset which was wonderful."

The bench we found ourselves sat on and the greenery was such a beautiful contrast to the high rise buildings, traffic and people. We walked 7.2 miles that day."
